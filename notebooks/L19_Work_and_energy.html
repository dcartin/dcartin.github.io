<h2><span class="section-number">19.1. </span>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In physics, one of the most powerful methods used to understand a situation is the use of conservation methods. Remember that these are cases where we can say some physical quantity for a system stays the same, regardless of any kind of interactions between components of the system. Knowing that something remains constant, even when you do not know all the details of what is happening to the system, allows you to find out a lot about the system’s evolution. We have seen two conservation laws already – the conservation of linear momentum (when there is no net external force), and the conservation of angular momentum (no external torque). This lesson and the next are now working towards the third: the conservation of mechanical energy. In particular, here I set the stage for energy by defining <em>work</em> and <em>kinetic energy</em>; <span class="xref myst">Lesson 20</span> will define <em>potential energy</em> and <em>mechanical energy</em>.</p>
<p>This is a good time to take stock of what we have covered to this point in the class as a whole, and what is coming up next. At this point, we have discussed <em>forces</em> and <em>momentum</em> (both linear and angular). The idea of a force is inituitively obvious – you probably have a sense of it as a “push” or a “pull”. Newton’s second law then built a bridge between forces and momentum, with net forces acting on an object changing the momentum of that object. We wrote down a mathematical definition of momentum, but the tie-in with Newton’s laws gives us an notion of momentum as a measure of the object’s <em>inertia</em>, its tendency to remain at a constant velocity unless acted on by outside forces. Using forces allows us to find the acceleration of an object, and the kinematic equations then give the complete motion of the object over a given time period.</p>
<p>Unlike forces and momentum, the idea of energy is not as intuitive. I can feel the force of the wall as I lean against it; I do not “see” the force of gravity, but I <em>can</em> see its effect on anything I let go of; friction and air resistance are so familiar that we automatically expect objects to slow down to a stop, and we may quietly think that inertia doesn’t quite make sense! However, I can’t see how the energy of a dropped object changes as it falls, or that of a car braking to a stop. So what is energy?</p>
<p>The picture I have in my head when I think of energy is that of accounting and money. If there is something I want, there are three ways that I can get it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I can barter with you, i.e. trade you another physical object that you want.</p></li>
<li><p>I can give you something, like gold or silver coins, which everyone has decided is a “store of value”. In other words, we usually do not need the coins themselves, but they are a <em>representation</em> of a certain utility to the person who currently has them.</p></li>
<li><p>I can use my credit card to buy the item. When I use the card, my bank will decrease the size of a particular number on its computer, and your bank will increase the size of another number on its computer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To me, energy is this last sense of money – in physics, we can attach certain numbers to objects, and these numbers change based on the motion of the object. By themselves, these numbers may be abstract, but as we will see, physicists have chosen the numbers well. Increasing or decreasing these numbers will represent physical processes, much like changing the number for my credit card buys my weekly groceries! So yes, energy is not something I can “put a finger on”, but it is tied to motions that I can observe. We will see that energy methods are very powerful, and are useful in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>Here are the objectives for this lesson:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Define work.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the meaning of the sign for the work done by a given force.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the work for a force that varies with time.</p></li>
<li><p>State Hooke’s law for a spring.</p></li>
<li><p>Define kinetic energy.</p></li>
<li><p>State the work-energy theorem.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the type of collision using kinetic energy.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="section-number">19.2.1. </span>Definition of work<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To get a start into energy methods, it is usual to begin with the notion of <em>work</em>. Unfortunately, this is a word that we use in everyday language to mean many things, but in physics, it has a very particular definition, given below, so it is very important to make sure you use the term properly.</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Intuitive idea behind work</p>
<p>Work transfers energy either into (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W &gt; 0\)</span>) or out of (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W &lt; 0\)</span>) a system.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, this may seem a bit circular, since we have not defined “energy” yet, but as we will see next, the mathematical definition of work includes forces acting over a distance. For now, think of it using our credit card analogy from above – work is like using the card to buy something, and changes numbers in our “energy” bank accounts that we will define later. Positive work will increase the energy of the system, while negative work will decrease the system’s energy.</p>

<p>We can put this intuitive into the form of a formula using the scalar product. This is given below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantity:</strong> work</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span> done by a force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> on an object moving over a displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> is given by</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Units:</strong> joules (J) = N <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cdot\)</span> m</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this to impulse <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec I} = \Delta {\vec p}\)</span>, which was a force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> acting over a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t\)</span>. Now we are looking at the action of a force on an object, as the object moves over a displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span>. The reason for defining impulse was its application with Newton’s second law of motion; by the end of this lesson, you will see how the work defined here ties into a particular form of energy.</p>
<p>How do we get back to our intuition about positive, negative, and zero work? Remember when we talked about the scalar product in <a class="reference internal" href="L13_Scalar_product.html#scal-prod"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 09</span></a>, that for two vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec A}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec B}\)</span>, the scalar <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec A} \cdot {\vec B} = AB \cos \theta\)</span>. Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are the magnitudes of the two vectors, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between them. Thus, the sign of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec A} \cdot {\vec B}\)</span> depends only on this angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. The idea is the same for the work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span> done by a force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span>; we can similarly use the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_F = F (\Delta r) \cos \theta_F
\]</div>
<p>With this intuition, then the sign of the work is determined by whether the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_F\)</span> between the force and displacement vectors, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> is acute, obtuse, or if the vectors are perpendicular. When <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_F &lt; 90.0^\circ\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos \theta_F &gt; 0\)</span> and the work is positive; the two vectors tend to point in the same direction. On the other hand, when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_F &gt; 90.0^\circ\)</span>, the vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> are pointing in opposite directions, more or less, and the work is negative, since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos \theta_F &lt; 0\)</span>. Finally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_F = 90.0^\circ\)</span>, the force and displacement vectors are perpendicular, and the work is zero, because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos 90.0^\circ = 0\)</span>. This is summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>Suppose you throw a ball straight upward. As the ball moves from sitting at rest in your hand to its maximum height, what is the <em>sign</em> (positive, negative, zero) of the works done by the following forces:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The force you exert on the ball throwing it upward</p></li>
<li><p>The force of gravity</p></li>
<li><p>The force of air resistance</p></li>

<p>As the ball passes through its highest point and starts falling downward, what is the <em>sign</em> of the force of gravity? Of air resistance?</p>
</div>
<div class="toggle docutils container">
<p><em>Answers:</em> While the ball is in your hand, you are exerting a force in the direction of its upward motion at that time; thus, your applied force is doing a positive work. On the other hand, as the ball moves upward, the forces of gravity and air resistance both point downward, so they do negative work.</p>
<p>When the ball moves from its maximum height down to the ground, the force of gravity is in the same direction as the motion, so gravity does positive work. However, the force of air resistance has now switched directions, and is pointing upward, opposite to the direction of motion. So again, air resistance does negative work.</p>

<p>If there are multiple forces acting on an object, we can find the work done by each of these individually. Then the <em>net work</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{net}\)</span> done on the object can be found in two different ways. Suppose there are forces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_1, {\vec F}_2, \dots, {\vec F}_k\)</span>, acting on the object; we will denote these as forces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_i\)</span> for labels <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i = \{1, 2, \cdots, k\}\)</span>. Then both of the following are true, if the object moves through a displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span>. First, find the work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{F_i}\)</span> done by each of the individual forces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_i\)</span>. The net work is then the sum of these individual works.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[

<p>The net work can also be found by finding the net force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{net} = \sum_i {\vec F}_i\)</span> acting on the object. The net work is then the work done by this net force.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

Suppose a 32.0 kg crate is pushed across a rough horizontal floor a distance of 10.0 m. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is 0.200. The person pushes on the crate with a force with a magnitude of 90.0 N, at an angle of 22.0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^\circ\)</span> below the horizontal. The crate accelerates to the right with a value of 46.2 cm/s<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>. We will determine the work done (in J) by each of the forces acting on the crate, then find the net work done by these forces.</p>

<p>First, before we do anything, we draw an FBD for the system. Notice that I have added the displacement vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> as a <em>dashed</em> arrow. This will be helpful to find the work, since we can use it to find the angle between each force and the displacement.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id2">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/INT_AY22_L19_Fig02_FBD_w_Dr.png"><img alt="../_images/INT_AY22_L19_Fig02_FBD_w_Dr.png" src="../_images/INT_AY22_L19_Fig02_FBD_w_Dr.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 19.2 </span><span class="caption-text">FBD for the crate, along with the displacement vector</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>Since we know (or can calculate) the magnitudes of each force vector, it makes more sense to use the magnitude-angle form of the work done by each force. Thus, it helps to find the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_F\)</span> between each force vector and the displacement vector. This is why drawing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> on the FBD is so helpful – we can basically read off all the angles. In particular, since the surface is flat, then the angles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_g\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_N\)</span>, for the gravitational and normal forces, respectively, are both zero. This leads immediately to their works <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_g = W_N = 0\)</span> J as well. We don’t even have to calculate the magnitudes of these forces!</p>
<p>However, it turns out we still need to find the magnitude of the normal force, in order to find the frictional force value. This is because the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{fr} = 180.^\circ\)</span> between the frictional force and the displacement. Writing down Newton’s 2nd law in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> direction, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \sum F_y = F_N - F_g - F_{app} \sin \theta_{app} = ma_y = 0
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_y = 0\)</span> since there is no vertical acceleration. This gives the equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    F_N = mg + F_{app} \sin \theta_{app}
\]</div>
<p>and so the work done by the frictional force is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{fr} = F_{fr} (\Delta r) \cos \theta_{fr} = \mu_k (mg + F_{app} \sin \theta_{app}) (\Delta r) \cos \theta_{fr}
\]</div>
<p>I want to pause here, and emphasize an important point. There are multiple angles involved in this problem, so you should give each of them a different name to avoid confusion. In particular, I have used a subscript to indicate which force each angle is associated with. I often see students make mistakes because they don’t do this!</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Do not confuse numbers of the same type</p>
<p>Different numbers should have different symbols. If you have multiple angles (or other similar variables), give them <em>descriptive</em> names so you do not confuse them. Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_2\)</span> are not very helpful, but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_g\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{fr}\)</span> give a better idea of what they represent.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{fr} = 180.^\circ\)</span> while the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{app} = 21.0^\circ\)</span>. Plugging in these numbers into the equation above gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{fr} = -692\)</span> J; the work done by friction is negative, since the frictional force points opposite to the crate’s displacement.</p>
<p>For the final force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{app}\)</span>, the work done is rather easy to find, since</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{app} = F_{app} (\Delta r) \cos \theta_{app}
\]</div>
<p>This gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{app} = 840.\)</span> J; the work is positive, since both the applied force points more or less in the same direction as the displacement.</p>
<p>Once we have these values, we can find the net work in two different ways, as spelled out above. The first is just to add up the answers we got for the individual works:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{net} = W_{app} + W_g + W_N + W_{fr} = 148 \textrm{ J}
\]</div>
<p>The other method, which gives the same answer, is to find the net force magnitude, using the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_x\)</span> given with the other numbers above, so that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{net} = m a_x (\Delta r)
\]</div>
<p>This also gives 148 J; having two methods is a great way to double check your results.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">19.2.3. </span>Graphing work done by gravity<a class="headerlink" href="#graphing-work-done-by-gravity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using vPython, we will now make a graph of the total work done by the gravitational force on an object near the Earth’s surface. Much of this we have already done before, the new part is finding the work done on the object. The program below includes code for an object <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball</span></code> dropped from rest from a height <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INIT_HEIGHT</span></code> above the object <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ground</span></code>. The code shows the animation of the ball, and also creates a graph of the total work done on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball</span></code> as a function of its vertical position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span>. The simulation stops when the ball hits the ground, since the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop only runs when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.pos.y</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code>.</p>
<p>In the code, you will have to do two things before the code is able to run. First, define the two vectors <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GRAV_FIELD</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NET_FORCE</span></code> for an object moving near the surface of the Earth, with only the gravitational force acting on it. Then, inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop, update the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">work</span></code> to find the total work done on the ball due to the net force. Use the definition of work given above to find this. Remember that you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dot()</span></code> in vPython to find the scalar product of two vectors; you can see this in action in <a class="reference internal" href="L13_Scalar_product.html#scal-prod-vpy"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 09</span></a>. In addition, the displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> is due to the velocity of the ball, so find this displacement over each time step <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DT</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.momentum</span></code>. How can you find the displacement of the ball over each time interval <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DT</span></code>?</p>
<p>When you have completed these steps, run the code and see what kind of graph you obtain.</p>

<p>If you have correctly implemented the physics into the program, your graph should look something like the following. Since the gravitational force points downward, positive work is done on the ball by gravity as it falls. The further the ball falls, the larger this work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_g\)</span>. Notice that this fall process starts at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span> on the <em>right</em> side of the graph, and then moves to the graph’s left side, as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span> decreases.</p>

<p><em>Answer:</em> The graph will be the same as the graph shown above. The work done by gravity only depends on the change in vertical position.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s see why the results of the previous two problems are true. Since the net force on the ball is a constant force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_g = m {\vec g}\)</span>, then the total work done on the ball is easy to find. Suppose that the ball starts at an initial position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_i\)</span> and reaches the ground at a final position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_f\)</span>. Then the work done by gravity is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_g = {\vec F}_g \cdot \Delta {\vec r} = (-mg) {\hat y} \cdot ({\vec r}_f - {\vec r}_i) = -mg(r_{f, y} - r_{i, y})
\]</div>
<p>Remember that taking the scalar product of a vector with a unit vector gives the component along the direction of the unit vector; for example, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\hat y} \cdot {\vec r}_f = r_{f, y}\)</span>. Thus, only the vertical motion of the object matters when finding the work done by gravity. Since the force of gravity only acts downward near the surface of the Earth, any horizontal motion of the object does not change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_g\)</span>. The velocity during its motion, or the time it takes to complete its trajectory, do not matter, either.</p>

<span id="work-ke-spring"></span><h3><span class="section-number">19.3.2. </span>The spring force<a class="headerlink" href="#the-spring-force" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now we will look at the spring force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{spr}\)</span>, and graph its work using vPython, similar to how we did it above for the gravitational force. The spring force vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{spr}\)</span> acting on a mass due to a spring is given by Hooke’s law, which states</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
{\vec F}_s = -k ({\vec r} - {\vec r}_0)
\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is known as the <em>spring constant</em> – the larger that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is, the stiffer the spring. The position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}\)</span> is the position of the mass acted on by the spring, while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_0\)</span> is the <em>equilibrium position</em> of the spring. If the spring is at its equilibrium point, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r} = {\vec r}_0\)</span>, then the spring does not exert any force on the mass. However if the mass moves away from the equilibrium position, the spring will exert a non-zero force on the mass. Finally, the minus sign out in front tells you that the direction of the spring force is opposite to the displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r} - {\vec r}_0\)</span> away from the equilibrium point. If you stretch a spring to the left, for example, the spring force will act towards the right. The spring always exerts a force that points from the mass towards the equilibrium position.</p>
<div class="hint admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Problem</p>
<p>What would a graph of the spring force vs. displacement look like? What is the interpretation of the slope for this graph?</p>

<p>We will return to the questions asked in the problem above, and see what the answers are; you should try it on your own first! You can gain some intuition about the spring force by using the PhET app below. In particular, make sure you understand how the magnitude of the spring force depends on the distance the spring is stretched or compressed, and how the direction of the spring force depends on which way you have moved the spring from its equilibrium point.</p>

<p>Let’s now create a spring in vPython. To create a visual representation of the spring itself, we will use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">helix</span></code>, which shows the helical spring between the origin and the mass on its end. Then, we create a ball on the end of the spring. Much like other shapes we have used before, a helix has some standard attributes, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pos</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">axis</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pos</span></code> sets the position of one side of the helix (not the center!), while <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">axis</span></code> gives the position of the other side of the helix relative to the position <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pos</span></code>. Finally, the attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radius</span></code> sets the width of the helix’s coil, while <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thickness</span></code> sets the size of the helix itself.</p>
<p>The program below does exactly what is described above: creates a red ball, with a helix extending from the coordinate origin <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((0, 0, 0)\)</span> to the ball. Note that placing the ball on the end of the spring is done by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spring.axis</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">ball.pos</span></code>. However, it is missing the pieces necessary for movement. So let’s put this spring into motion, using the spring force equation given at the beginning of this section. As currently given, the velocity of the ball does not change due to the spring. Thus you must add in the correct force in the line where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.momentum</span></code> is updated. Use the spring force equation above, along with the fact that the net force (given by the spring force) is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\sum {\vec F} = m \frac{\Delta {\vec v}}{\Delta t}
\]</div>
<p>To update <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.momentum</span></code>, you will need to use the net force on the mass, along with mass of the ball <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.mass</span></code> and the spring’s force constant <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spring.constant</span></code>. Thus, these need to be set to the proper values, in terms of the definitions of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OBJ_MASS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SPRING_CONST</span></code> given at the beginning of the program. If you do this correctly, the motion of the mass should be oscillatory, moving back and forth.</p>

<p>This oscillatory motion can be seen by making a graph of the horizontal position of the mass as a function of time. In the place indicated in the program above, create a graph <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">posGraph</span></code> and a curve <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">posCurve</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">posGraph</span></code>. For reference, you can look back at <a class="reference internal" href="L03_Velocity_and_Euler_method.html#vel-euler-graphs"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 03</span></a> to remind yourself how to do this.

Inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop, update <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">posCurve</span></code> using the time <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t</span></code> and the horizontal position of the mass <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.pos.x</span></code>.

<p>What kind of motion do you get if the mass has a non-zero initial velocity? In particular, given the initial conditions in the program, what would the initial velocity of the mass have to be, in order to have the mass undergo uniform circular counterclockwise motion in the x-y plane?</p>

<div class="toggle docutils container">
<p><em>Answer:</em> In general, giving the mass a non-zero initial velocity gives rise to the mass moving along an elliptical orbit.

<p>Hopefully you now have a decent understanding of the spring force. Next, we will graph the work done by this spring force as a function of position, much as we did for the force of gravity earlier. You will modify the program below to do this. However, unlike the gravitational force, we cannot just use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta W_{spr} = {\vec F}_{spr} \cdot \Delta {\vec r}\)</span> since the spring force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{spr}\)</span> changes with position.

<p>Up to this point, we have a definition of work, and have seen various examples of how to calculate it. But we have not really proven that work is the flow of energy into or out of a system. In fact, we haven’t even defined energy yet! So let’s make up for that, by showing how work is related to a quantity describing the motion of a system.</p>
<p>Using Newton’s second law and the defintion of total work, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{tot} = (m {\vec a}) \cdot \Delta {\vec r}
\]</div>
<p>If we write out what the scalar product means on the right-hand side of this equation, we get (factoring out the common mass)</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{tot} = m (a_x \Delta r_x + a_y \Delta r_y + a_z \Delta r_z)
\]</div>
<p>If you remember from when we discussed the kinematics equations in <a class="reference internal" href="L06_Kinematic_equations.html#kin-eqns"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 06</span></a>, we had three equations that had pieces that looked like this; these were</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    v^2 _{f, x} = v^2 _{i, x} + 2 a_x \Delta r_x \qquad
    v^2 _{f, y} = v^2 _{i, y} + 2 a_y \Delta r_y \qquad
    v^2 _{f, z} = v^2 _{i, z} + 2 a_z \Delta r_z
\]</div>
<p>Thus, combining these equations and doing some algebra, the total work on the object can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} m [(v^2 _{f, x} - v^2 _{i, x}) + (v^2 _{f, y} - v^2 _{i, y}) + (v^2 _{f, y} - v^2 _{i, y})]
\]</div>
<p>If we use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, the final speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_f\)</span> of the object is given in terms of its components by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    v^2 _f = v^2 _{f, x} + v^2 _{f, y} + v^2 _{f, z}
\]</div>
<p>and the same can be done with the initial speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_i\)</span>. Therefore, the total work can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 _f - \frac{1}{2} m v^2 _i
\]</div>
<p>This equation is known as the <strong>work-energy theorem</strong>. For situations where there is an acceleration due to the net force, the total work done on the object is given by the change in this quantity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1/2) mv^2\)</span> over the displacement. This relates to the motion of the object – it features both mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> and speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> (not velocity!) – so we call it <strong>kinetic energy</strong> (remember “kinetic” means “motion”), and denote it by the symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">A subtle point about net work</p>
<p>Let’s be careful about what the work-energy theorem is saying. We are assuming that we have some kind of object, with a center of mass position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_{CM}\)</span>. Because of a combination of <em>external</em> forces, this CM position can accelerate at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec a}_{CM}\)</span>. So, in other words, we are not worrying about any internal forces, e.g. between parts of the object pushing against each other as it moves faster or slower. Thus, whenever I define a net work using the last equation, I am really talking about the <em>center of mass</em> work on the object. At this point, you may think I am being very picky over something that doesn’t matter. For now, you would be right! However, when there are other changes to the system – e.g. the object changes size, volume or internal energy (temperature) – then net work may alter more than just the kinetic energy. There is also another general point: whenever you see a derivation, always know what the assumptions are, since they might not always be true!</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantity:</strong> kinetic energy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equation:</strong> With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> the mass of the object, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> the object’s speed,</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Note: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> is a scalar quantity, and is always positive</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Units:</strong> joules (J)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we have shown that when the only change in the system is its speed, net work results in a change in kinetic energy, depending on the <em>relative</em> direction between the net force and the displacement.</p>
<p>So we now have our first form of energy – kinetic energy is a number related to the motion of an object. In addition, the net work shows how this quantity changes. A positive net work increases the kinetic energy of the system, while a negative net work decreases it. When there is no net work, the kinetic energy remains the same. This is the reason I said at the beginning of this lesson that work is the flow of energy into or out of the system.</p>

<span id="work-ke-coll"></span><h2><span class="section-number">19.5. </span>Revisiting collisions<a class="headerlink" href="#revisiting-collisions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, you recall from <a class="reference internal" href="L11_Center_of_mass_and_collisions.html#cm-coll"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 12</span></a> when we considered collisions between objects. In that lesson, we used the concept of the coefficient of restitution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> to divide up collisions into elastic and inelastic collisions. Specifically, I defined the coefficient of restitution as the ratio of the final to initial <em>relative</em> speeds of two objects. If I call these objects 1 and 2, with initial velocities <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec v}_{1, i}, {\vec v}_{2, i}\)</span>, and final velocities <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec v}_{1, f}, {\vec v}_{2, f}\)</span>, then we have that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \epsilon = \frac{|{\vec v}_{1, f} - {\vec v}_{2, f}|}{|{\vec v}_{1, i} - {\vec v}_{2, i}|}
\]</div>
<p>The advantange of this definition is that the difference between an elastic and an inelastic collision is more visible, particularly in the “springiness” of the collision. An elastic collision, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = 1\)</span>, is one where the two objects leave the collision at the same relative speed as they enter it. If you were an ant on one of two colliding hockey pucks, from your vantage point, you would see the second puck enter and leave the collision with the same speed. On the other hand, an inelastic collision, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1\)</span>, has the ant see the final relative speed as less than the initial; the pucks do not bounce off of each other with the same “springiness” as they came into the collision. When <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = 0\)</span>, the two objects stick together, so their final relative speed is just zero.</p>
<p>Although classifying collisions according to relative speeds is nice, it has the disadvantage that the calculation can be involved, especially when considering collisions in two dimensions. Notice that we are finding the difference in two velocity vectors (before and after the collision), then the magnitude of this difference. Coding this in vPython is not too bad, but doing it by pencil and paper can be lengthy. It would be nice to have another method to divide up collisions.</p>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">The fine print</p>
<p>The reason the ratio of the kinetic energies is not the same as the coefficient of restitution is a little subtle. However, it basically boils down to the fact that the sum of the system’s kinetic energy really includes <em>two</em> contributions. The first is the kinetic energy of the system, taken as a whole, as its moves with its center of mass velocity. This is the part coming from the fact we can consider the system as if it were one object. The second contribution are the individual kinetic energies, coming from the “internal” motion of each object, relative to the system as a whole.</p>
<p>When defining the coefficient of restitution as the ratio of relative speeds, the vector difference inside the relative speed calculation nicely gets rid of the center of mass motion. This leaves only the internal motions of each object. Unfortunately, doing the same for kinetic energy would involve some extra effort, so I don’t worry about it here.</p>

<p>It turns out there is, in fact, another way to find out if a collision is elastic, using kinetic energy! Unfortunately, this does not map over cleanly to the coefficient of restitution, although that concept is in the background. The idea is to look at the change in the kinetic energy of the system as a whole. I will do this by looking at the final system kinetic energy of the system, as a fraction of the initial system kinetic energy. This can be expressed as the ratio</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{\sum K_f}{\sum K_i}
\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_f\)</span> are meant as the initial and final kinetic energies. To spell this out, suppose we have two colliding objects 1 and 2. Then the ratio would be</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{K_{1, f} + K_{2, f}}{K_{1, i} + K_{2, i}}
\]</div>
<p>Now, if all of the kinetic energy is preserved after the collision, then this ratio is equal to one; the sum of kinetic energies is the same, before and afterwards. Thus, for an <em>elastic</em> collision,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{K_{1, f} + K_{2, f}}{K_{1, i} + K_{2, i}} = 1 \qquad (\textrm{elastic})
\]</div>
<p>This is just another way of saying that the final system kinetic energy is 100% of the initial. On the other hand, if kinetic energy is lost during the collision (and goes into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound), then the ratio is less than 1. Therefore, for an <em>inelastic</em> collision,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{K_{1, f} + K_{2, f}}{K_{1, i} + K_{2, i}} &lt; 1 \qquad (\textrm{inelastic})
\]</div>
<p>Note that the ratio is <em>not</em> necessarily zero for a completely inelastic collision, when the two objects stick together! They may still be moving, just with the smallest possible kinetic energy.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the two-dimensional collision examples in <a class="reference internal" href="L11_Center_of_mass_and_collisions.html#cm-coll-2d-coll"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 12</span></a>, to see how this works. For the first problem, I will repeat the problem statement here, but you should go back to the original discussion to remind yourself of how we did it there. The drawing below shows a collision between two pucks on an air-hockey table. Puck A has a mass of 23.0 g and is moving along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> axis with a speed of 5.50 m/s. It makes a collision with puck B, which has a mass of 63.0 g and is initially at rest. The collision is not head-on. After the collision, the two pucks fly apart with the angles shown in the drawing. The final speed of puck A is 3.38 m/s.</p>

</div>
<p>When we worked out the problem previously, we found that the final speed of puck B was 1.858 m/s. If we use the kinetic energy ratio test above, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{K_{1, f} + K_{2, f}}{K_{1, i} + K_{2, i}} = \frac{0.2401 \textrm{ J}}{0.3479 \textrm{ J}} = 0.6901
\]</div>
<p>Thus, the final kinetic energy of the system is only 69.0% of the original system kinetic energy, and the collision is inelastic. We already knew the pucks’ speeds, before and after the collision, and the calculations only involve scalar kinetic energies, so there is less math involved! However, if we did <em>not</em> know the speeds, but instead the velocities, it is usually simpler to just use the coefficient of restitution, as we did in <a class="reference internal" href="L11_Center_of_mass_and_collisions.html#cm-coll-2d-coll"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 12</span></a>.</p>

<p>Look back at the second 2D collision problem from Lesson 12 (“Smashing particles”), and find the value of the kinetic energy ratio. What kind of collision is this?</p>
</div>
<div class="toggle docutils container">
<p><em>Answer:</em> The ratio is 1.000, so 100.% of the total kinetic energy remains in the system, and the collision is elastic.</p>

<p>We have now defined the basics of energy – work and kinetic energy – as well as the work-energy theorem that relates the two. As we will see in the next lesson, we will build off of this relation in order to define conservation of mechanical energy. This will be done by focusing on how to find the net work on a system. In particular, we will find that there are special forces, where for each such force, we can define a “potential energy”. This potential energy, like the kinetic energy, is simply a scalar, whose change tells you something about the evolution of the system in time.</p>
<p>After this lesson, you should be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Define work and kinetic energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the work done by any force.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the change in kinetic energy due to a force acting over a displacement.</p></li>
</ul>
