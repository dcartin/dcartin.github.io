<p>In the last lesson, we found the work done by any generic force, as the system it acts on undergoes a displacement. This force could be constant (such as the force of gravity near the surface of the Earth) or changing (like the spring force). However, this is not the best way to divide forces, at least when talking about work. Instead, we will see that it is best to focus on those forces where the work done by the force leads to a scalar uniquely defined at every state of the system. This scalar will be known as a <em>potential energy</em> of the force, and the force will be known as a <em>conservative force</em>. The reason to do this is that if we can associate a specific scalar – the <em>mechanical energy</em> of the system – based on both kinetic and potential energies, then a constant mechanical energy allows us to predict the evolution of the system.</p>
<p>So our gameplan for this lesson is the following. First, we discuss which forces we can define potential energies for. There are a limited number of such forces, but they will be very helpful to use. This means we need to specify the difference between a conservative force and a non-conservative force; a potential energy can only be defined for a conservative force. Then we can add up the kinetic energy and all the potential energies of the system to get the system’s mechanical energy. If only conservative forces act on the system, then the mechanical energy is conserved, according to the work-energy theorem of the last lesson. However, if we have non-conservative forces as well, we need to take these into account. That will be the final portion of this lesson.</p>
<p>Here are the objectives for this lesson:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Define potential energy, and describe its relation to the force done by a conservative force.</p></li>
<li><p>Define mechanical energy, and explain when mechanical energy is conserved for a system.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the relationship between mechanical energy and the work done by non-conservative forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system, when non-conservative forces are present.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an energy graph for an object, describe the motion of the object.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="section-number">20.2. </span>Conservative vs. non-conservative forces<a class="headerlink" href="#conservative-vs-non-conservative-forces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As outlined in the last section, our first step is to see where we can define a potential energy. Before we do that, let’s motivate why we can do that in the first place! For some forces, the work done by that force can be “stored” in the system. To see what that means, imagine that you have a person skating on a frictionless surface. You can see this by running the PhET app below, selecting “Intro”, and then moving the person onto the ramp and letting go. The skater will then move along the ramp.</p>
<div class="cell tag_remove-input docutils container">

</div></div>
</div>
<p>If you watch the motion of the skater, you will see that they will continue moving forever. When they start at the top of the ramp, the gravitational force will pull them along the ramp, and they will speed up until they reach the bottom. At that point, as they start moving up the opposite side, gravity will slow them down, until they reach the same height again. But there is no friction, so this process will repeat itself over and over! There is some physical quantity related to gravity that is lost when the skater moves down the ramp, but is gained back in full when going back up the other side.</p>
<p>Let’s make this idea more general by considering some unknown force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> acting on an object. Suppose you take the object and you move it from point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> in the figure below, using the long path with the green arrow. You find that the unknown force does 60 J of work on the object. Then you use the shorter path (the red arrow) to move the object back from point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> to point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>. In this case, the force does -60 J of work.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id3">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/INT_AY20_MP2_L16_Fig01-Path_dependence_of_work_small.png"><img alt="../_images/INT_AY20_MP2_L16_Fig01-Path_dependence_of_work_small.png" src="../_images/INT_AY20_MP2_L16_Fig01-Path_dependence_of_work_small.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 20.1 </span><span class="caption-text">The amount of work done by a force may depend on the path taken</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>Traveling from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> you must put 60 J of work into the system due to a force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> (“storage”), while from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, 60 J of energy is taken out of the system due to force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> (“release”). Said a different way, there is <em>no change</em> in the energy of the object when it takes a full cycle around the two arrows. This means for this force, there is some quantity that remains the same, regardless of how you go along the path. If we go against the arrows, then the signs of the works flip, but we still get the same net work of zero.</p>
<p>This force is known as a conservative force. A <strong>conservative</strong> force is one where the work done by the force on an object does not depend on the path taken by the object, for given initial and final points – all the energy put into the system can be gotten back out at a later time.</p>
<p>Note that this is not true of all forces! Imagine that the force of friction were acting on the object as it followed the two arrows (you can think of this as moving on the surface of a table). Since the force of friction has a constant magnitude, the work done by friction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{fr}\)</span> is greater for a larger distance. In addition, the frictional force is always opposing the motion of the object, so the work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{fr}\)</span> will be negative, regardless of which arrow you follow. Thus, the force of friction is <em>not</em> a conservative force – you can’t get back energy from friction!</p>

<p><em>Answers:</em> Only the gravitational and spring forces are conservative; air resistance and friction are non-conservative. To see the latter, imagine you move an object in a circle, and return to the starting point. Since both air resistance and friction point opposite the direction of motion, they both do negative work. Thus, the total work in a closed path is negative for both forces. On the flip side, for both gravity and the spring force, these forces are against the motion for some parts of the path, and with the force along other parts, so the total work done by these forces is zero.</p>

<p><em>Answer:</em> You only need to check the simplest loops for this diagram; if these all meet the requirement of a conservative force, then so will other possible paths. However, you can see that there is a problem with edge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BE\)</span>, since neither of loops <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BCE\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BDE\)</span> lead to zero around a closed path. For example, the total work done along the path <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \to C \to E \to B\)</span> is -6 J, not zero.</p>
</div>
<p>For conservative forces, the work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span> done by the force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> is the same, regardless of which path you use to move from the starting to the final positions. This is why we can use the following definition for the potential energy of a <em>generic</em> conservative force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span>, based on this work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantity:</strong> potential energy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The change in potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_F\)</span> for a conservative force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> is defined in terms of the work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_F\)</span> done by that work as</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \Delta U_F = -W_F = -{\vec F} \cdot \Delta {\vec r}
\]</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Units:</strong> joules (J)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the work done by the force only defines the <em>change</em> in potential energy. This means that only this change has physical consequences! Said a different way, the absolute size of the potential energy doesn’t matter, so we are free to choose a <strong>reference point</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_{ref}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_F (r_{ref}) = 0\)</span>. However, sometimes there is a natural choice of this reference point, either to make the calculations simpler, or there is a special point of physical relevance. This is something to keep in mind for the spring force (Hooke’s law), and the general form of gravitational potential energy (which we will see in <a class="reference internal" href="L22_Gravitational_potential_energy.html#gpe"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 22</span></a>).</p>

<p>Thus, we can see that this naturally fits into the pattern above, where the work done by a conservative force defines a change in potential energy.

<p>A second conservative force is the spring or elastic force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{spr}\)</span>. Suppose a mass at position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}\)</span> is attached to a spring with spring constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> and equilibrium position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_0\)</span>.

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    {\vec F}_{spr} = -k({\vec r} - {\vec r}_0)
\]</div>
<p>This was an example of a non-constant force, so to find the work done by the spring force, we needed to use the area under the curve. If you went through the vPython simulation and algebraic problems in Lesson 23, you would have seen that the work done by the spring force when the mass is moved from position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_i\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}_f\)</span> is</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">20.4. </span>Conservation of energy<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now have all the elements we need to talk about the conservation of mechanical energy. To do this, let’s start with the work-energy theorem from <a class="reference internal" href="L19_Work_and_energy.html#work-ke-ke-thm"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 19</span></a>. For now, let’s just write kinetic energy as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span>, so for a given system, the work-energy theorem says</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{tot} = K_f - K_i
\]</div>
<p>Now, we can go through the list of all forces acting on the system, i.e. all forces included in the total work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{tot}\)</span>. Some of these forces will be conservative forces, and thus have their own potential energy; the rest of these forces will be non-conservative. Therefore, we can write the total work as the sum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_c\)</span> of the work done by conservative forces, and the sum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc}\)</span> of work done by the non-conservative forces.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_c + W_{nc} = K_f - K_i
\]</div>
<p>The work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_c\)</span> is made up of the changes in potential energy for all the conservative forces. Thus, if we have conservative forces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_1, {\vec F}_2, \cdots\)</span>, up through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_j\)</span>, for an index <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>, then each will do a work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_j = -\Delta U_j\)</span>. So the sum is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_c = -\Delta U_1 - \Delta U_2 \cdots - \Delta U_j = -(U_{1, f} - U_{1, i}) - (U_{2, f} - U_{2, i}) \cdots - (U_{j, f} - U_{j, i})
\]</div>
<p>But this sum of the differences is the same as the difference in the sums!</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_c = -[(U_{1, f} + U_{2, f} \cdots + U_{j, f}) - (U_{1, i} + U_{2, i} \cdots + U_{j, i})]
\]</div>
<p>Let’s write these in terms of summations, as a way to put these equations together:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_c = -\sum_j \Delta U_j = -\sum_j (U_{j, f} - U_{j, i}) = -(\sum_j U_{j, f} - \sum_jU_{j, i}) = -(U_f - U_i)
\]</div>
<p>In the last step, we have added together all of the initial potential energies of the system and called it <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_i\)</span>; similarly, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_f\)</span> is the sum of all the final potential energies of the system. Putting this back into the work-energy theorem,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{nc} - (U_f - U_i) = K_f - K_i
\]</div>
<p>Moving the change in total potential energy to the right-hand side gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{nc} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_f - U_i) = (K_f + U_f) - (K_i + U_i) = \Delta(K + U)
\]</div>
<p>Thus, when there are <em>no</em> non-conservative forces (i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc} = 0\)</span>), the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies of the system remains the same. This is an important result, so we give this sum the name <strong>mechanical energy</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantity:</strong> mechanical energy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> is defined as the sum of all kinetic and potential energies for a system:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
	E = K + U
\]</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Units:</strong> J</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, this means adding in all possible forms of these energies; at this moment, mechanical energy includes gravitational and elastic potential energies:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
	E = K + U_g + U_s
\]</div>
<p>The general statement of conservation of energy relates the change in the mechanical energy to the work done by non-conservative forces</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \Delta E = W_{nc}
\]</div>
<p>In the absence of non-conservative forces (friction, air resistance), mechanical energy is conserved:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \Delta E = W_{nc} = 0 \Rightarrow E_i = E_f
\]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    K_i + U_{g, i} + U_{s, i} = K_f + U_{g, f} + U_{s, f}
\]</div>
<p>This last equation will be our typical starting point. It is good practice to begin with the most general case, and think about which kinds of energy are present at the initial and final states of the system. Choosing these states cleverly will help greatly as well!</p>
<p>It may helpful to look at particular situations, so you can see how the changing state of a system relates to the kinetic, potential, and mechanical energies. If you go back to the simulation of the skater previously mentioned in this lesson, you can see how the kinetic and gravitational potential energies of the skater depending on the ramp shape and height. Use the pie chart or bar graph for pictorial representations of the various energies as the skater moves along the ramp.</p>
<p>Here is another related simulation, where the motion of a mass on a vertical spring can be studied. Select “Energy” when the app loads up, so you make look at the various types of energy in the system.</p>

</div>
<p>The first thing to realize is that in the middle position, where the block is at rest on the vertical spring, is <em>not</em> where the “energies balance out”. The block is at rest because the net force at this location is zero; if this was not true, the spring and block would start accelerating. Thus, we first need to use Newton’s second law here. This will allow us to calculate the spring constant of the vertical spring, which we do not know at this point. The net force on the block is due to the upward force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{spr}\)</span> on the block from the spring, as well as the downward force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_g\)</span> of gravity. Setting the magnitudes of these two forces equal to each other,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \sum F_y = F_{spr} - F_g = ma_y = 0
\]</div>
<p>then the spring constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k = mg / \Delta r_y\)</span>. Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta r_y\)</span> is the vertical distance from the equilibrium point of the spring to where the block comes to rest, and so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta r_y = 2.64\)</span> cm (as a magnitude, since we have already taken into account the signs in the equation above).</p>
<p>Now we can look at what happens when the block is pushed down further. The net force will <em>not</em> be zero here, since the spring force is larger than the block’s weight. This is why the block will accelerate upward until it is pushed completely off the spring. Since the spring force depends on the distance the spring is away from its equilibrium, we cannot use the kinematic equations – the acceleration changes with time, so it is not constant! This is why using the conservation of mechanical energy is the best choice: we only need to know what is happening between the initial state (when the block is pushed down to its lowest point) and the final state (the block has left the spring, so the spring is no longer compressed).</p>
<p>So, we start with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc} = 0\)</span> (no friction), and write down the conservation of mechanical energy equation,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    K_i + U_{g, i} + U_{s, i} = K_f + U_{g, f} + U_{s, f}
\]</div>
<p>If we take the initial and final states outlined in the paragraph above, then the block is (momentarily) at rest at both of these points. This means <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_i = K_f = 0\)</span>. The spring is also not compressed in the final state, since the block is no longer sitting on it, giving <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{s, f} = 0\)</span>. The block is compressing the spring at the beginning, however, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{s, i} \neq 0\)</span> from the total compression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.64 + 5.36 = 8.00\)</span> cm from the equilibrium. Last, we turn to the gravitational potential energy. Here we need to make a choice about where to put the reference height. This is different than the choice for the spring potential energy, which was already chosen (when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_s\)</span> was defined) to be the spring’s equilibrium position. Since there is no strong reason to choose one height over another, let’s pick the block’s final position as the height where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_g = 0\)</span>. This gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{g, f} = 0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{g, i} = mgh\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h &lt; 0\)</span> is the distance from the starting and ending heights of the block – negative since the initial position is below the final. Thus, our final energy conservation equation is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    0 + mgh + \frac{1}{2} kr^2 = 0 + 0 + 0
\]</div>
<p>We can solve for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> to get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    h = -\frac{kr^2}{2mg} = -\frac{r^2}{2 \Delta r_y}
\]</div>
<p>In the last step, we used the equation for the spring constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> we got earlier when the net force was zero. Note that the mass of the block doesn’t matter! Plugging in the numbers, and taking the absolute value, we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|h| = 12.12\)</span> cm. However, this is the total distance from the initial to the final heights, and we want only the height above the spring’s equilibrium point. So, we subtract 8.00 cm from 12.12 cm to get 4.12 cm for our final answer.</p>

<p>In the situations given above, we did not include any non-conservative forces. Remember that these would be forces such as friction or air resistance, and would change the mechanical energy of the system. This is the natural next step for extending our energy methods. If an object encounters a non-conservative force between its initial and final states, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc} \ne 0\)</span> – mechanical energy is added to, or removed from, the system and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta E \neq 0\)</span>. Note that this equation can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    W_{nc} = \Delta E \Rightarrow E_f = W_{nc} + E_i
\]</div>
<p>The right-hand equation tells the story: the system starts with a mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_i\)</span>, then in the process of going from the initial to the final state, there is an energy flow (or work) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc}\)</span>, leading to a final mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_f\)</span>. Another way to write this matches what was done above, where the initial mechanical energy is now on the left, as is the non-conservative work <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{nc}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    K_i + U_{g, i} + U_{s, i} + W_{nc} = K_f + U_{g, f} + U_{s, f}
\]</div>
<p>Here are some practice problems to give this modified energy equation a whirl. Remember that these problems just combine what we have done in this lesson and the last – for the non-conservative forces, you have to find the work by those forces using the methods of <a class="reference internal" href="L19_Work_and_energy.html#work-ke"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 23</span></a>; otherwise, it is an energy problem as we have done in this lesson.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to a situation like we had earlier, with the <a class="reference internal" href="#energy-spring-ex"><span class="std std-ref">vertical spring example</span></a>. Suppose we have an ideal spring again, with spring constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>, placed so that it is aligned vertically. The spring will have some equilibrium length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{0, y}\)</span>. Since the spring is ideal, it has no mass of its own, but we can imagine placing a block of some mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> on top of the spring. The spring-mass system will have both gravitational and spring potential energy; thus, the total potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> of this system is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    U = \frac{1}{2} k(r_y - r_{0, y})^2 + mgr_y
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span> is the vertical position component of the mass. If we graph this function, we get the plot shown below.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id13">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig01_U_vs_r_graph.png"><img alt="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig01_U_vs_r_graph.png" src="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig01_U_vs_r_graph.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>

</div>
<p>In the graph, I have marked the equilibrium position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{0, y}\)</span> of <em>just</em> the spring. However, the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> is not lowest at that point, because of the addition of the gravitational force, and its contribution to the potential energy. The point where the potential energy is lowest is the equilibrium point when <em>both</em> the spring and gravitational forces on the mass are taken into account! Remember in the vertical spring example above, the mass was placed on the spring, and came to rest at a distance of 2.64 cm below the equilibrium of the spring. This would be the point where the total potential energy is the least. I will come back to that point in a bit.</p>
<p>Now, let’s imagine that we place the mass on the spring, and press it down some further distance. Before we let go of the mass, all of the system’s energy will still be potential energy – no motion, no kinetic energy. I have placed a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span> on the graph below to show this bottom point. I will explain the rest of the graph as we go along.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id14">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig02_U_vs_r_graph_w_ME.png"><img alt="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig02_U_vs_r_graph_w_ME.png" src="../_images/INT_AY22_L20-Fig02_U_vs_r_graph_w_ME.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>

</div>
<p>So, what will the system do after I get go? Hopefully, you are not surprised that the mass starts moving upward. I will describe this in two different ways. First, let’s talk about it in terms of the separate forces of gravity and the spring. Since the mass is now below the equilibrium point it was resting at before, the spring force has a larger magnitude than the gravitational force, and the mass is pushed upwards. This is because the spring has an even greater compression than it did when the mass was motionless, which increases the size of the spring force.</p>
<p>However, there is a second way to predict the motion, based solely on the graph. Intuitively, imagine the point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span> as if there was a ball placed on the graph. You would expect the ball to “roll downhill”, to the right of the graph. This intuition matches a more rigorous description. Since both the gravitational and spring forces are conservative, we can say the total potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> graphed above is related to the total force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_{net}\)</span> by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \Delta U = - {\vec F}_{net} \cdot \Delta {\vec r}
\]</div>
<p>Let’s use the fact that the displacement <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r}\)</span> is only vertical, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta {\vec r} = (\Delta r_y) {\hat y}\)</span>. This gives that the magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{net}\)</span> of the net force is related to the change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta U\)</span> in potential energy by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \Delta U = -F_{net} \Delta r_y
\]</div>
<p>If I rearrange this, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    F_{net} = - \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta r_y}
\]</div>
<p>This is just the (negative of the) slope of the graph! Since the slope of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> vs. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span> graph is negative at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span>, then the <em>force</em> is <em>positive</em>, i.e. to the right, which means the mass will move to higher <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Force is slope of potential energy vs. position</p>
<p>Suppose an object moves along a line, with position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, due to the influence of a potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U(r)\)</span>. The net force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}\)</span> on the object will be</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    {\vec F} = \biggl( -\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta r} \biggr) {\hat r}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>Now we can see why the equilibrium point for the system is at the point when the potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> is at its smallest. At that position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span>, the slope of the graph is zero, so the net force on the object will be zero there as well. Again, think of the analogy of the ball; if you place a ball at that point, it will not start rolling uphill! This equilibrium point is known as a <strong>stable equilibrium</strong>: a position where the net force is zero, and where moving a small distance to either side means the system experiences a net force which returns it back to the original point. This is opposed to an <strong>unstable equilibrium</strong>, where the force is zero precisely at the point, but moving just a little bit away gives rise to a net force that amplifies that motion. Think about balancing a pencil on its point; you can do it if you are careful, but the slightest motion will make the pencil fall down.</p>
<p>Let’s now get back to the graph. Notice that I have drawn a dashed horizontal line on the graph; this line is placed at the value of the <em>mechanical energy</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> for the mass. Obviously, this touches the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> curve at the point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span>, since the mass is motionless there, so the kinetic energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K = 0\)</span>. But why did I draw this line? Because it tells us what the motion of the mass will look like after we let go of it. Again, as we saw above, when the mass is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span>, the force on it is in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+y\)</span> direction, so the mass will move upward. On the potential energy graph, as you move to the right, there is a gap between the dashed line for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>, and the potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span>. What is this gap? It is the difference <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E - U\)</span>, which is precisely the kinetic energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> of the system! Thus, just from the graph, we can see that the mass will initially speed up with increasing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_y\)</span>. However, once the mass passes the equilibrium point for the system, the gap gets smaller, and the mass will slow down. Eventually, the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> of the system will equal the potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> at the vertical distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{top}\)</span>. At this point, the mass will stop, and then start moving downward. Because there are no non-conservative forces, this motion will repeat indefinitely, with the mass oscillating between the highest and lowest points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{top}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{bot}\)</span>, respectively.</p>

You might think adding a spatial dimension would make the graphs more complicated (since they would now be three dimensional!). In general, this is the case, but it turns out things remain relatively simple if we consider only central forces, which we talked about in <a class="reference internal" href="L16_Circular_motion.html#ucm-cent-force"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 16</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="L18_Angular_momentum.html#ang-mom-cent-force"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 18</span></a>.

    U_F = F_c r
\]</div>
<p>Thus, we can write down the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> of the object as the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. However, before I do this, I will use the Pythagorean theorem to decompose the velocity into its radial and perpendicular components <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_r\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span>, respectively. After this step, I have the mechanical energy is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 _r + \frac{1}{2} mv^2 _\perp + F_c r
\]</div>
<p>Suppose we want to know what the inner and outer radii are of the orbit. In other words, what is the smallest distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> the object gets to the center <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r} = {\vec 0}\)</span>? What is the largest distance it gets from the center? Since we only care about the radial motion of the object, let’s do something clever. I will group together everything that is <em>not</em> the kinetic energy piece depending on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_r\)</span> into a single part <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span>, with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    U_{eff} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 _\perp + F_c r
\]</div>
<p>This is known as the <strong>effective potential energy</strong>, defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    U_{eff} = E - \frac{1}{2} mv^2 _r
\]</div>
<p>Using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span> allows us to focus purely on the radial motion of the system; we can treat the object as moving only in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> due to the effective potential energy of the system.</p>
<p>In particular, we can find the velocity component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span>, at a given radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, once we know the constant magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> of the angular momentum of the system. Remember in <a class="reference internal" href="L18_Angular_momentum.html#ang-mom"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 18</span></a> that we can write the magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> of the angular momentum for a point mass in terms of the perpendicular velocity component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    L = rmv_\perp
\]</div>
<p>With some algebra, you can show that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \frac{1}{2} mv^2 _\perp = \frac{L^2}{2mr^2}
\]</div>
<p>This is a step forward, since the magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> is constant for central forces; therefore, this term is now only a function of the radial distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. This means that now the effective potential <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span> is also just a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. So we can analyze the system by looking only at how the object changes its radius over the course of its motion, ignoring the perpendicular piece entirely.</p>
<p>I show this by using the central force simulation we saw previously in Lesson 18 for the constant central force. In this version, I have put in an energy graph with two curves: the effective potential <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span> in blue, and the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> in green. Since mechanical energy is conserved, the green line is flat; the difference between the green and blue curves is the <em>radial</em> piece of the kinetic energy, i.e. the part that depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_r\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Notice that we now have another way to explain why the ball never goes closer to the center than some fixed radius. Remember, when I first introduced this central force in <a class="reference internal" href="L16_Circular_motion.html#ucm-cent-force"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 16</span></a>, I described this inner radius in terms of the constant central force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_c\)</span> versus the necessary centripetal force to keep it in circular motion. There, for radii <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_c - mv^2 /r &lt; 0\)</span>, the net acceleration is not enough to keep it moving in a circle, so the radial velocity component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_r\)</span> will slow down, until the object stops moving inward at the inner radius, and starts moving outward. Using what we have talked about in this lesson, we can express this same process, but in terms of energy. As the ball approaches the inner radius, an increasing amount of its mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> is in the perpendicular piece <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L^2 / 2mr^2\)</span> of the kinetic energy, while the radial part <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1/2) mv^2 _r\)</span> will decrease in size. Eventually, there is no available energy for the radial portion, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_r = 0\)</span>, and the ball turns around. The turning points of the ball (both inner and outer) are when the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> equals the effective potential energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span>. There is an “energy barrier” to the ball moving too close to the center, due to its angular momentum!</p>
<p>Thus, we now have enough information to solve for these turning points of the ball – those radial distances <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> where the ball is at its maximum and minimum distance from the center. To do this, let’s first find the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> of the system, using the initial values in the program. With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_c = 10\)</span> N/m, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m = 4\)</span> kg, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 5\)</span> m, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v = 3\)</span> m/s, then</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 + F_c r = 68.0 \textrm{ J}
\]</div>
<p>Now, at the turning points, this mechanical energy will equal the effective potential energy, with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    E = \frac{L^2}{2mr^2} + F_c r
\]</div>
<p>In other words, the object has momentarily stopped its radial motion, so there is no radial kinetic energy at the turning point. Recall from when we went through this simulation previously in <a class="reference internal" href="L18_Angular_momentum.html#ang-mom-cent-force"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 18</span></a> that the magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> of the angular momentum was 60.0 kg m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span> / s<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>. Thus, with a little bit of algebra, this last equation becomes an equation for the unknown <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    F_c r^3 - E r^2 + \frac{L^2}{2m} = 0
\]</div>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Why is the start a turning point?</p>
<p>The ball starts at a turning point because the initial velocity is chosen to be perpendicular to the radial position vector. Thus, the ball is not moving outward or inward at this radius. Whenever it returns to this radius, since the angular momentum and mechanical energy remain the same, this will be true. Thus, the ball will always momentarily stop its radial motion at this distance. Note that whether this is the <em>innermost</em> or <em>outermost</em> radius depends on the values of the initial speed and radius. In addition, if the initial velocity is <em>not</em> perpendicular to the radial position, then the initial position is no longer a turning point; you will see an example of this below, with the spring force.</p>
</div>
<p>This may look daunting, since it is a cubic equation. However, if you try the starting radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 5\)</span>, you will see that this gives a solution to the equation – the ball begins at one of its turning points. It turns out that knowing this root is enough to solve for the other roots. Let’s plug in the numbers, so it is more obvious what is going on. This gives (dropping the units)</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    10 r^3 - 68 r^2 + 450 = 0
\]</div>
<p>However, since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 5\)</span> is a root, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((r - 5)\)</span> is a factor of this polynomial, so that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    10 r^3 - 68 r^2 + 450 = (r - 5)(ar^2 + br + c)
\]</div>
<p>for some unknown coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b, c\)</span>. Thus, when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r \ne 5\)</span>, it is the second factor that must be zero; this can be easily solved for the last two roots of the polynomial. The two positive solutions of the overall equation will be the outer and inner radii of the object’s motion.</p>

<p>Everything I said above for the constant central force also applies to any other central force. Thus, given a central force, an object moving solely due to this force will have an effective potential energy. We can then explore the properties of the motion with other central forces using the same techniques. To see this, below is a modified version of the mass on a spring program we saw in <a class="reference internal" href="L19_Work_and_energy.html#work-ke-spring"><span class="std std-ref">Lesson 19</span></a>.

<li><p>Suppose you change the initial speed so that it is now 2.50 m/s; do not change any of the other variables. What would be the turning points of the mass in this scenario? Note the angular momentum magnitude is now different!</p></li>

<p>Now, suppose the initial velocity is <em>not</em> perpendicular to the radial position vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec r}\)</span>. Let’s change initial velocity in the program above, so it has the same magnitude, but a different direction. Change the code</p>

<p>Inside the definition of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball</span></code>, you will need to assign the attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ball.velocity</span></code> to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INIT_VEL</span></code>. The initial velocity now points at a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta = 30.0^\circ\)</span> angle to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+x\)</span> axis, rather than strictly along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+y\)</span> axis, as before. This change means that the initial velocity has both a perpendicular component <em>and</em> a radial component at the start. Because of this, the motion will be different; if you run the program, you will see the ball moves further out, along a “tilted” ellipse. The change in the initial velocity means the angular momentum magnitude has changed; we can solve for its new value (using the <em>original</em> speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> of 1.50 m/s) by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

The new angular momentum magnitude has changed the shape of the effective potential energy, which is noticeably more asymmetric in the radial direction. However, the mechanical energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> has <em>not</em> changed, since the initial speed is exactly the same as before!

<h3><span class="section-number">20.8.3. </span>Finding the stable equilibrium<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-the-stable-equilibrium" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For both the constant central force, and the spring force, you may have noticed that both graphs look basically the same (although not exactly!). In particular, both are “bowl shaped”, so there is a radius in each case where the slope of the effective potential is zero. Much like we talked about in the last section, this radial distance would be where the object is at a stable equilibrium; if the object were placed slightly away from this point, they would oscillate around the equilibrium distance.</p>
<p>It is important to note what is being said here. When I talk about <em>just</em> the potential energy, like I did in the last section, I am considering only motion along a single direction – imagine the mass on a spring moving back and forth on the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> axis. Then, the stable equilibrium point is where the mass would be completely stationary. However, when I talk about the <em>effective</em> potential energy, I am talking about two dimensional motion, since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{eff}\)</span> includes the angular momentum of the object moving perpendicular to the radial direction. Here, the stable equilibrium would be that radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> <em>and</em> perpendicular velocity component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span> such that the radius does not change. In other words, the object is moving in a circular orbit at precisely this equilibrium distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>To flesh this out, let’s go back to the constant central force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\vec F}_c\)</span> and find the stable equilibrium radius for the angular momentum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> for the default values. We have to keep <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> the same as the original value, or else the effective potential energy graph would change! Thus, we want to solve the following equations for the equilibrium radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_e\)</span> and the perpendicular velocity component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    L = mv_\perp r_e \qquad
    F_c = \frac{mv^2 _\perp}{r_e}
\]</div>
<p>The first is just the fact we are keeping the angular momentum magnitude the same, so that the effective potential energy graph is the same; the second is Newton’s 2nd law, relating the constant force magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_c\)</span> to the net force. You can solve these algebraically for either <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_e\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span> in one equation, then subtitute into the other equation, to get equations for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_e\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\perp\)</span>. For the equilibrium radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_e\)</span> in particular, this gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    r_e = \biggl( \frac{L^2}{F_c m} \biggr)^{1/3}
\]</div>
<p>With the default values in the program, and the angular momentum magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L = 60.0\)</span> kg m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>/s<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span> we found previously, then the equilibrium radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_e = 4.48\)</span> m.

<p>Energy methods are one of the most powerful techniques in physics. Notice that it is all in one equation! That is one of the advantages of using conservation of energy. In fact, if you decide to pursue physics as a major, you will see that many of the more advanced methods you will see are just different versions of writing down the mechanical energy of the system.</p>
<p>The flip slide, though, is that all the energies are scalars, so information about direction is lost. For example, you can use mechanical energy to find the speed of an object at a given position, but not its velocity, since you cannot determine the drection using a scalar. However, with that being said, you can learn a lot from using the conservation of mechanical energy.</p>
