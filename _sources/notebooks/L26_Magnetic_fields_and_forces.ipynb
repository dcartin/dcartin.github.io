    "After the gravitational field, magnetic fields are probably the next most common example of a field in everyday life. I am sure you have played around at least once with bar magnets, and seen how the various poles of the magnets attract or repel. You may also have used a compass to navigate around, emulating sailors who have done this for centuries. In fact, the Chinese have been using compasses for that purpose for over a thousand years. Before that, they used the magnetic properties of lodestones for divination; it is not too surprising that a mystical purpose was given to stones that naturally seek to align with the Earth's magnetic field! In today's technology, magnets run the gamut from the speakers in your headphones, to the \"M\" in \"MRI\" when you go to the doctor's office.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore magnetic fields, and the forces they exert on moving charges. Some of this will be similar to what we did with gravitational and electric fields. However, magnetic fields and forces feature interesting behavior unlike those other fields. In particular, magnetism is inherently three-dimensional, so we will lean heavily on the vector ideas we have been using throughout the course.\n",

    "## Magnetic fields\n",
    "\n",
    "I am now going to introduce the idea of a magnetic field. This is denoted by the symbol ${\\vec B}$. We have already covered two fields before -- the gravitational and electric fields -- and much of your intuition from those should carry over. In particular, the magnetic field is something that everyone agrees on; no matter how you measure the magnetic field, you will get the same answer for ${\\vec B}$ as any other observer. This is the central intuition you should always remember about *any* type of field. However, as we will see, magnetic fields are more complicated than the fields we have dealt with before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the other fields, we can draw magnetic field lines for ${\\vec B}$. Remember that the direction of the electric field ${\\vec E}$ at a particular point is given by the direction of the electrostatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ on a positive charge placed at that point (*not* the direction of its velocity!). So we can imagine using a positive charge to map out the directions of the electric field, then connect these directions together to get electric field lines. We can do something similar with a magnetic field. As our operative definition, we have the following.\n",

    "```{admonition} Direction of magnetic field\n",

    "The direction of the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at a point $P$ is given by the direction the \"north\" end of a compass would point when placed at that point.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, just like an electric field, we can use a compass to map out the directions of the magnetic field at particular points, then stitch these directions together to get magnetic field lines. A wonderful demonstration of this (and standard fare at every elementary school!) to use to iron filings around a bar magnet, to show the field of the magnet. This works because the iron filings act like small compasses, so they map out the field very well.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the picture above, the bar magnet itself has two **magnetic poles**: north and south. The magnetic field lines go between the north and south poles. Outside of the bar magnet, the magnetic field lines go *from* the north pole *towards* the south pole. From our method of finding the direction of magnetic field lines from compasses, this means that the north pole of the compass is attracted to the south pole of the bar magnet. Much like charges, opposites attract!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Poles are not charges\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "Students often see this *analogous* behavior between electric charges and magnetic poles, and go forward and say that it is because they are *equal*. This is not true! Magnetic poles are not the same as electric charges. They display similar behaviors, regarding directions of forces and field lines, but they are distinct physical properties. In fact, we will see later that magnetic poles are created by the motion of electric charges.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice that the magnetic field lines never end. Instead they form loops, with each line starting at the north magnetic pole, extending outside the bar magnet to the south magnetic pole, then joining up again to itself back at the north pole. *Magnetic field lines have no beginnings or ends*. This is different than electric field lines, which start and stop at electric charges. This is a manifestation of a physical observation: there is no such thing as an isolated magnetic pole, they always come in north/south pairs. We refer to two opposite magnetic poles, such as a bar magnet, as a **magnetic dipole**. A single pole (or *magnetic monopole*) has never been seen, although there are theoretical reasons to expect that they may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of direction for the magnetic field lines has another interesting consequence. Remember that these field lines are given by which way the \"north\" end of a compass points. Because opposite poles of a magnet attract, this means that the north *geographic* pole of the Earth is where the south *magnetic* pole of the planet's magnetic field is! Our compass points (roughly) north because it is attracted to a south magnetic pole! As you can see in the picture below, the magnetic field of the Earth has roughly the same magnetic dipole behavior as a bar magnet.\n",

    "There are many cases where the circular motion of charges around the magnetic field lines occurs. One of which we depend on every day! The strong magnetic field of the Earth channels charged particles, coming from the Sun and other sources in outer space, along its field lines. This serves as a barrier for most of these charges, preventing them from hitting the Earth's atmosphere. If they did in great numbers, this would steadily erode the atmosphere, destroying the ozone layer, and eventually stripping the Earth of its air. In comparison, it is believed that the weak magnetic field of Mars was a key factor in that planet's loss of atmosphere; the surface pressure at the Martian surface is only about 600 pascals (compared to 101.3 kPa on the Earth!).\n",

    "Another common use for the process described above is the **mass spectrometer**; you may have heard this term if you watch a lot of crime shows. A mass spectrometer takes an unknown substance, ionizes the constituents in some way, then feeds these molecules into a constant magnetic field. By determining the path of these molecules, the molecular charge-to-mass ratio $q/m$ can be calculated. Early versions of this were used by various physicists to study \"cathode rays\", those particles we now call electrons. The picture below shows such a process -- the air molecules inside the tube are fluorescing because of collisions with the electron beam.\n",

    "Let's go through an estimate of how large the circular path of electrons would be in a laboratory experiment. Suppose we use a voltage $\\Delta V = 3000$ V to accelerate the electrons. Voltage $V$ (as known as electric potential) is related to electric potential energy $U_e$ by $\\Delta U_e = q \\Delta V$, for a charge $q$. This gives each electron a kinetic energy of $e \\Delta V = 4.81 \\times 10^{-16}$ J. With the mass $m_e = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg, then the electrons have a speed of $3.25 \\times 10^7$ m/s -- about 1/10th the speed of light. Using this speed in the Earth's magnetic field of about 50.0 $\\mu$ T, then the electrons will travel in a circular path with a radius of 3.69 m. In the picture above, a magnetic field is created which is about ten times stronger than the Earth's field, so the path is correspondingly smaller.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now introduced the last of the three types of fields we will see in this course: the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$. Like the gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ and the electric field ${\\vec E}$, the field at a particular point is measured to have the same magnitude and direction by all observers, and is used to find the corresponding force on an object at that point. The simplest system creating these magnetic fields is the magnetic dipole, consisting of a pair of magnetic poles, one a north pole and the other a south pole. Examples of these magnetic dipoles range from a simple bar magnet to the overall structure of the Earth's magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we saw that a charged particle moving in a magnetic field undergoes circular motion around the field lines; if the charge's velocity has non-zero components both parallel and perpendicular to the field, then the motion will be helical around the field lines. This has many applications, such as the mass spectrometer, as well as others in particle physics experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have not touched on the important question of how these magnetic fields are created. For the gravitational and electric fields, this was relatively easy. In particular, we could start with the fields due to a point mass or charge (depending on which field type we are talking about!), where the field magnitude was an inverse square law, and the direction was given by the unit vector ${\\hat r}$, either in the same direction or opposite the position vector. Then, we could add together the contributions of a large number of point masses or charges to get the fields due to more complicated shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in the next lesson, this basic recipe is the same, with magnetic fields created by the motion of charged particles, or currents. However, like the magnetic force equation we saw in this lesson, the field created by a \"point current\" involves the vector product, so it is not so simple as, say, the gravitational field of a point mass. This is dealt with using Biot-Savart law in the next lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State the direction of the magnetic field due to magnetic poles.\n",
    "* Interpret a drawing of magnetic field lines.\n",
    "* Describe the motion of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field."
