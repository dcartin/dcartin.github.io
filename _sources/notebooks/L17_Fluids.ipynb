    "Anything that you do in the sea services depends fundamentally on the properties of fluids. If you fly aircraft, you maintain altitude because of the lift on the wings or blades of your vehicle. The depth your submarine cruises at is a result of how much air versus water the boat has in its ballast tanks. Whether you are a sailor or a marine, your ship stays on the water because a naval architect has ensured the ship is buoyant and maintains its stability in choppy weather. Air and water are two prominent examples of fluids, but there are many others you can probably think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that \"buoyant force\" refers to the total force a fluid exerts on an object; however, this force results from the difference in pressure on the top and bottom of the object. The pressure on the bottom is almost always greater, giving an upwards buoyant force. Therefore, this lesson starts with the idea of pressure, and builds on that to develop the buoyant force. It was the great thinker Archimedes who came up with a relatively simple way to find the buoyant force, over two thousand years ago. If you use the resulting Archimedes' principle, you will have an able guide to understand situations with fluids.\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define pressure and density.\n",
    "* State the density of fresh water.\n",
    "* State the value of standard atmospheric pressure in SI units.\n",
    "* Explain Pascal's principle.\n",

Or how you \"feel\" this push? It turns out your skin actually measures the amount of force over a given area, not the absolute size of the force. So, if you exert the same force, but over a larger portion of your body, it does not feel as painful as if you apply the same force to a small area.\n",

Thus, for a denser fluid, the weight would be larger, even if nothing else changed, since there is more mass above the point. Similarly, if you take the container of fluid to another planet, with a different gravitational field, the weight will change for that reason. Finally, if you change the depth of the point you are measuring, there will be more or less fluid above that point, giving a different pressure reading. Notice that moving horizontally will *not* change the pressure, since the amount of fluid above the point has not changed.\n",

In particular, the World Meteorological Organization defines a standard atmosphere as:\n",

The only difference is that, since we are now going *up* in the fluid (i.e. the atmosphere!), it is more convenient to use the height $r_z$, instead of a depth $h$. Since we are increasing our height, rather than going downward in depth, we need to take this difference into account by using $\\Delta r_z = -\\Delta h$. Again, the minus sign comes from the fact we are moving upward in the fluid, not downward. Thus, our first equation relates pressure $P$ to the distance $r_z$ above sea level, or\n",

    "As mentioned above, for a stationary fluid, the shape of the container does not matter when measuring the pressure at a given depth. Let's explore this notion some more. We can think of the fluid as composed of imaginary bags, each of which is pressing against its neighbors, or the container walls. In equilibrium, these forces will balance out, and the fluid remains stationary. If they did *not* balance out, then the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" would give it an acceleration until the forces *did* balance out, and equilibrium is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose there is an outside force acting on the fluid. This could be something like a piston pressing down on the fluid, or even a change in atmospheric pressure above a lake as a storm front comes into the area. This results in a change in the force on the top of the fluid. The \"bags of fluid\" will then rearrange themselves to account for this different force, until the fluid is again in equilibrium. Every change in pressure from outside the fluid will result in the same change in pressure everywhere inside the fluid as well, an idea known as **Pascal's principle**. One consequence is that the ressure of a stationary enclosed fluid at one vertical height is the same pressure at a different point with the same vertical height. If it were not, the fluid would flow until the pressures are equalized, and the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" is now zero.\n",

Now let's raise the gauges upward, one of either side of the tube, so that they are always in the same depth of water inside the tube. Because they are in the same fluid at the same depth, they will still read the same pressure. This is true *until* the gauge going up the right side crosses into the oil; because the oil has a different density, the pressures will now be different on either side of the tube.

The steam bubble quickly collapses, dropping the ship downward and breaking the keel.

This means there is a greater force $F_{bot}$ on the bottom surface area $A_{bot}$ than the force $F_{top}$ the fluid exerts on the top area $A_{top}$. The buoyant force will be upward because of this difference. Because we are using a cylinder for simplicity, $A_{bot} = A_{top} = A$; we can do the same thing for more complicated shapes, but it requires more math. In addition, the forces on the side will not matter, since the forces on opposite sides of the cylinder middle will cancel out.\n",

Since the blocks are identical, the two buoyant forces must be the same!

    "Here's another example to work through. Suppose you have a cone with a given density $\\rho_{cone}$; the top of the cone is a circle with a radius $r$, and the cone has a total height $h$. You place the cone in a fluid of density $\\rho_{fl}$, and it floats. How far down into the fluid does the cone sink before coming to rest? First, we need to know the volume of a cone, which is\n",

Hopefully it is clear from the picture below that the ratio of the total radius $r$ and height $h$ of the cone is the same as the radius of the cone $r_{fl}$ and the height of the cone $h_{fl}$ that is immersed in the fluid. In other words,\n",

    "Now, let's use these facts to find out where the \"water line\" of the cone is, i.e. what depth $h_{fl}$ is immersed in the fluid. Since the cone is floating, then $F_{g, cone} = F_B$. Thus,\n",

    "Obviously, this is sensible, as we can see with two test cases. If the two densities are the same, then the cone will be completely immersed in the fluid. For the opposite case, as the cone density gets very small, then very little of the cone will be immersed in the fluid. In between, most of the cone's volume is away from the tip and towards the base. This means that, for example, if the cone has half the density of the fluid, then almost 80% of the the cone must be in the fluid! There is very little cone volume near the tip, so the cone must be more than halfway in the fluid to get the forces to balance out.\n",
