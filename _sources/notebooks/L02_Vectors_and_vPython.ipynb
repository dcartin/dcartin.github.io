    "# Vectors and vPython\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson covers two crucial portions of the class: the mathematical idea of a vector, and the programming tool called vPython. Let's briefly summarize each of these in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuitive idea you should have for a *vector* is an arrow -- something with a direction, and a size or scale. On the other hand, *scalars* are basically numbers, with no direction associated with them. Many of the physical quantities we will talk about in physics are best described as vectors, such as velocities, forces, momenta, and fields. You will see vector equations that relate these quantities. However, it is important to realize that these equations have a few important differences with equations made up only of scalars. Understanding these differences is crucial for a good grasp of physics concepts, so we will continually revisit this topic over the course of many lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to describe a vector, and this lesson will hopefully give you a handle on these. First, you can go back to the idea of a vector as an arrow, and draw these on paper to see how to add or subtract them. This will be the idea behind \"graphical vector addition\". This technique is great for giving you a rough idea of the size and direction of a vector. We will use graphical vector addition frequently in this context -- for example, when we draw the \"free body diagram\" of the forces acting on an object in [Lesson 13 (Solving force problems)](force-prob). We will also draw the \"vector diagram\" of many vectors, in order to find their \"vector components\". This is the second, and more mathematical, way of describing vectors. The components of a vector tell you how much of the vector is along each axis. This will also allow you to calculate the sum of multiple vectors. As a way to tie these two methods together, you will also see how to draw vectors using programming techniques. In particular, you will see that the codes using the mathematical relations gives you the graphical addition of arrows we would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help understand these and many other physics concepts, we will use the vPython package. Often in a programming language, the command of the language must be supplemented to make more features available. The 3D graphics package vPython for the Python programming language was created by David Scherer while he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University. It has since been modified and developed by many others into a vibrant community. vPython allows you to create and animate 3D objects, and to navigate around in a 3D scene by spinning and zooming, using the mouse. vPython will build upon your new Python programming experience, and hopefully you will have fun doing so!\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need vPython? Why can't we just use the formulas and calculate things with them? My experience as a teacher is that many times, students see mathematical equations as a fancy machine that you put numbers into, then you get other numbers out of. What do they mean? \"Well, my roommate (or a supplemental instructor, or somebody in my platoon) told me to do it this way, and...\" This means you don't really get it at all. *Learning is doing. Full stop.* My goal with using vPython is that you *understand* physics a little better than you did when started the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} How to read these lessons\n",
    ":warning:\n",
    "This is the first lesson where we start dealing with calculations of physical quantities. I emphasized at the beginning of Lesson 01 that these lessons are meant to be interactive, and it is the same here: *do not read these notes like a novel*. What I mean by that is\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should have a pencil, paper, and a calculator by your side before you even start reading the lesson.\n",
    "* As you go through, try the problems listed, and check to see if you can do them. If not, come to class with a question about your confusion.\n",
    "* Don't skip parts just because you don't understand them! Make a decent effort to carefully read the text, and try the problems. Note this does *not* mean to get bogged down. If you devote a good deal of time, and it still does not make sense, come and ask me, either in class or EI. But at least give it the ol' college try.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will confess that I often don't follow my own advice, and I frequently come to regret it. I can get away with it when reading about material I already understand fairly well, but when I am trying to learn something new, I usually crash and burn because I have not been methodically working through the concepts. Then I have to start over, and read it again. And again. And again. If learning was easy, everybody would do it.\n",
    "```\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the difference between a scalar and a vector.\n",
    "* Describe the effect of scalar multiplication of a vector.\n",
    "* Write a vector in proper unit vector form, given its components.\n",

    "Now let's get into the nitty gritty, and talk about scalars vs. vectors. Many of the things we do in physics will depend on the idea of a \"vector\", so it is very important to understand the difference between a vector and a \"scalar\". Intuitively, a scalar is just a number. If we put units on a scalar, some examples would be the time of day you are reading this, and the temperature in the room where you are reading it. A vector, on the other hand, can be best thought of as an arrow -- a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude (size) and direction. The velocity of an object is a vector, since it has a size (how fast are you moving?) and a direction (which way are you moving?).\n",

    "1. **Scalar:** A number representing the size (or magnitude) of a quantity. Examples are mass, temperature, electric charge.\n",
    "1. **Vector:** Intuitively, we can think of a vector as an arrow, which has both size and direction. Examples include velocity, acceleration, force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see a symbol with an arrow sign above it, you should read it as a vector. Examples are the velocity vector ${\\vec v}$ and the acceleration vector ${\\vec a}$. A symbol without an arrow sign is a scalar. Note that there is a scalar associated with every vector -- namely, its size! So, when I talk about the momentum *vector*, I use the symbol ${\\vec p}$, but when I talk about the *scalar* magnitude of the momentum vector, I use $p$ (or sometimes $|{\\vec p}|$). Know the difference!"

It is this last part you have to be careful about -- many different kinds of quantities are vectors, so don't get too wrapped up in the idea of \"magnitude = length\". This is why I used the word *scale* before. I can draw an arrow to represent a force vector, where 1 centimeter of arrow length on my drawing denotes 10.0 N of force magnitude. \n",

    "The reason I emphasize this here is that sometimes you will draw multiple vectors -- representing *different* quantities -- in the same problem, and if you confuse every vector with a length (or each other!), you will have problems. One place I see this a lot is when doing projectile motion problems [(Lesson 07)](proj-mot). Here, you may have an initial velocity vector to show how a cannonball is launched from a cannon, and a displacement vector giving its final position relative to its start. These vectors are *not* the same! They are generally not in the same direction, either. However, I sometimes see students calculate the final position of a cannonball using the initial velocity. Projectiles do not move in straight lines, because of the gravitational field of the Earth. Confusing your vectors will lead to this false conclusion.\n",

You should see that you are able to zoom the arrow into and out. Now try holding down only the right mouse button, then move the mouse. You should find that you are able to rotate around the arrow, because of the change in the sphere's shading; vPython is creating a light source at a specific point which is illuminating the sphere. Note that you are changing your viewpoint (like moving a camera) rather than changing the position of the sphere. You are zooming and rotating the camera, not the sphere.\n",

    "In this lesson, you have learned about vectors, one of the fundamental objects we will use throughout this course to describe both the motion of objects -- such as position, velocity, and acceleration -- and the properties that determine that motion -- for example, momentum, forces, and fields. The technique of graphical addition, either drawing by hand or using vPython to create the arrows can demonstrate the appearance of the scalar multiple of a vector, or of a vector sum. These methods will be put in practice often (starting with the next lesson!), so you should make sure you have a firm grasp of these topics.\n",
