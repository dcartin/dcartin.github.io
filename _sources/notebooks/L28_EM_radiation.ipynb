    "Ever since Newton split sunlight into its component colors using a prism in the 1600s, physicists have been trying to explain the properties of light. This was a long debate, partly because the experimental evidence was confusing. Some of it suggested that light was made of particles, while others thought it was due to waves. This issue was not really settled until the 1920s, with the advent of quantum mechanics, where light has aspects of both particles and waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one aspect of this debate I want to focus on. Proponents of the wave theory had a serious question to confront: is light is a wave, what is waving? All other waves known at that time had a physical medium that oscillated -- waves on the ocean are the motion of water, you hear sound waves because of vibrations of air. How do light waves reach the Earth from the Sun? There was a guess that there was a somewhat mysterious substance, called the \"ether\", that filled all of space, whose vibrations were precisely light waves. Unfortunately, the ether theory had its own problems, and eventually, new experiments were done to show that the ether could not exist. For the most famous of these experiments, one of the two scientists involved was Albert Michelson, who served some time as instructor at the US Naval Academy; Michelson Hall is named after him! It was Einstein's theory of special relativity, however, put the nail in the coffin for the ether.\n",

    "```{margin} Maxwell's equations\n",
    "There are actually four Maxwell's equations, but we only need two for this lesson. The missing two are called *Gauss' law for electric fields* and *Gauss' law for magnetic fields*. The first starts from the physical fact that electric field lines start and stop on electric charges, and allows you to calculate the electric field very easily for certain symmetric situations. The corresponding magnetic field law says that magnetic field lines never end! There is a lot more to these laws than this brief summary, but that would be a whole other lesson...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore the resolution of this problem. Spoiler alert: light doesn't need anything to do the waving! Light is the arrangement of electric and magnetic fields in such a way that they self-propagate -- light waves itself. The fact that light can do this is built into Maxwell's equations of *electromagnetism*, one of the great triumphs of 19th century physics. What we will see in this lesson is that these equations are exactly what is needed. In particular, how the fields change in space leads to how they change in time; light is an electromagnetic wave where these two changes mutually reinforce each other to give a moving wave. We will see how this works using two of Maxwell's equations: the Ampere-Maxwell law and Faraday's law.\n",

    "At the end of the last lesson, I motivated the equation giving the magnetic field due to a long, straight wire. To find this properly with the Biot-Savart law takes some effort, either with integral calculus, or else by using vPython to code an appropriate simulation.

I will start with the long, straight wire, and imagine that I am moving in a circular path, whose center is at the center of the wire. Depending on how I walk around the circle, and which way the current is going through the wire, I will see the magnetic field either always in the *same* direction as I am walking, or else in the *opposite* direction. Below is a situation where the current is coming out directly towards you; we can use the right-hand rule to figure out the counterclockwise direction of the magnetic field created by this current.\n",

    "I will now play a similar game to what I did in [Lesson 27](biot-savart:circ-loop) to find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop: namely, to approximate the circular path we are using here with a polygon. Suppose I am walking around the path in a counterclockwise direction. Then, I have a vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ along each side of the polygonal approximation to the circular path. Notice this is much like what I did with the circular loop, but with one key difference. There, I used the $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ to indicate the pieces of the current loop, whereas here, I am using it for the segments of the path where I *measure* the field due to the current wire at the center. The picture thus looks like that shown below. There are $N = 12$ sides to the polygon approximation, and I have moved the magnetic field vectors ${\\vec B}$ a short distance away from the wire for clarity.\n",

In fact, this is exactly what is going on here: any \"conservative\" field will give a zero sum around a closed loop. By **conservative field**, I mean a field that would give rise to a conservative force, such as the forces of gravity or a spring. Much like those forces, a conservative field can be written in terms of a function, just like a conservative force can be derived from a potential energy, as in [Lesson 20 (energy graphs)](energy:graphs).

Another way I can describe these fields is *Coulombic*, because we derived the electric field for point charges from [Coulomb's law](electrostatic-force) for the electrostatic force.

On the other hand, if the field lines pass straight through the loop, we should get maximum flux. This is shown pictorially below, where the closed loop is the dashed line, and the area enclosed by the loop is shaded in. The vector field ${\\vec V}$ is represented by the arrows.\n",

With maximum flux, we see this is when the vector field ${\\vec V}$ through the area is in the same direction (or parallel) at the area vector ${\\vec A}$. The flux is zero when ${\\vec V}$ is perpendicular to ${\\vec A}$ -- the field is along the area, but not through it.\n",

    "Let's now put some of these ideas into practice, and turn to the first of the two Maxwell's equations we will be using, namely Faraday's law. I want to recap the pieces we will use in this relation. First, remember we talked about the sum of scalar products $\\sum_k {\\vec V}_k \\cdot \\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$ of a vector field ${\\vec V}$ around a closed loop, given by the distance vectors $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$. This sum is non-zero only when the vector field is non-conservative, i.e. the vector field is \"swirly\". For Faraday's law, we will be considering the electric field around the loop, so it will be testing for non-conservative electric fields. We can use the same closed loop to find the magnetic flux $\\Phi_B$ through the loop. However, the important aspect will be the change in this magnetic flux with time; Faraday's law relates this change to the scalar product sum.\n",

    "is a voltage difference, just like you have for a battery. So, Faraday's law says that any voltage difference around a *closed* loop gives rise to a change in magnetic flux. A conserative electric field will always have zero voltage difference around a closed loop; this is how I originally defined a conservative field! So only non-conservative (or \"swirly\") electric fields will result in a magnetic flux changing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an important point you should keep in mind: the *cause* of a voltage difference around a closed loop will result in an *effect* of a changing magnetic flux with time. Unfortunately, Faraday's law is not usually taught in this manner, but is described with the cause being the change in magnetic flux, and the result is the non-conservative electric field. However, this does not make any sense. Let's go back to Newton's second law, written in terms of linear momentum ${\\vec p}$ as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum {\\vec F} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec p}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it makes sense to say that the net force is the cause of the change $\\Delta {\\vec p}$ in linear momentum, rather than the other way around! We have seen many equations of this form, where the rate of change of one physical quantity is given in terms of the values of other quantities. For all of these, we say that the rate of change is a result, rather than why things happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's turn back to something I mentioned before, about the direction of the normal vector we use to define the magnetic flux. There is also another choice we have to make, namely how we go around the closed loop at the outside of the area. It turns out that, for Faraday's law to be consistent, we need to link these choices together! If we do this properly, it doesn't matter which way I go around the loop, as long as I pick the normal vector to match my choice. Using Faraday's law correctly depends on the consistency of these two choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this work? Consider the area shown below, where I have drawn arrows on the boundary loop to indicate the direction I will go around this loop. Now, curl the fingers of your right hand around the boundary loop; your thumb should naturally point in the direction I have drawn the normal vector ${\\hat n}$. Said a different way, for the choice of normal vector given, the positive direction around the loop will be in the counterclockwise direction. For Faraday's law to be consistent, you must make the choice of loop direction and normal vector match up like this. Since the area vector ${\\vec A}$ is just a scalar multiple of the normal vector ${\\hat n}$, this gives the relationship between the area vector ${\\vec A}$ and the positive direction along the boundary.\n",

Since the magnetic flux is changing through the loop, Faraday's law tells us that this is the result of a non-conservative electric field ${\\vec E}$. Since the magnetic field is uniform, this electric field will have circular field lines, as shown below; I will show after the picture why the direction of the field is chosen the way it is.\n",

    "From the last problem, the choice of the normal vector gives that the positive direction around the loop is counterclockwise; this is indicated on the diagram above as a reminder. This will be the direction of the vectors $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$ we use in the sum $\\sum_k {\\vec E} \\cdot \\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$. Thus, this is just like the vPython function `circularLoopSum()` you wrote for an earlier problem; we can imagine approximating the circular loop as a polygon, like we did there. Now, let's turn to the left-hand side of Faraday's law. Even though the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ is *into* the picture, opposite the direction of the normal vector ${\\hat n}$, the field is *decreasing* in size. Therefore, the vector $\\Delta {\\vec B} / \\Delta t$ points *out of* the picture, in the same direction as the normal vector. This is how, in a previous problem, you found the change in flux $\\Delta \\Phi_B / \\Delta t$ with time to be positive. Bringing all of this together, we have that the left-hand side of Faraday's law is positive, thus so must the right. Because of the minus sign, this means that the sums of the scalar products ${\\vec E}_k \\cdot \\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$ are negative. This is how I know the direction of the non-conservative electric field above.\n",

    "I started with lesson with Ampere's circuital law, which relates the current wire passing through a closed loop to the scalar product using the wire's magnetic field. However, there is a problem with this equation: it only works in the situation where there is no change. The standard explanation of this problem is to imagine two uncharged metal plates (these form a circuit element known as a capacitor), which are then connected using wires to a battery. The battery will cause charge to flow through the wires, so that one plate has its excess electrons pulled off, moved through the wires and battery, to be deposited on the other plate. Thus, the net result of connecting the plates to the battery is an increasing positive charge on one plate, and an increasing negative charge on the other. A side view of the situation is represented in the picture below.\n",

    "Now, suppose we are near one of the wires, but far away from the charging plates. Using Ampere's circuital law, we see that the current through the wire is creating a magnetic field around the wire. So far, so good. If we look at a point between the two plates, the two plates have opposite charges, so there is an electric field between the two plates. Since the plates are charging, this electric field between the two plates is increasing in magnitude.\n",

    "What I said above for the loop around the wire made an assumption about what area I used for that loop, namely, the area was like a soap bubble, so that it was as small as possible. This is the situation shown to the left in the figure below. But that's not the only way I can draw the area. In fact, as long as the loop used is the boundary of the area, I can use any area I want. So let's try an area which passes between the plates, as shown on the right; this area is like a hat or an open soup can, where the wire is passing into the open side. This is where the problem comes in -- the wire no longer goes through the shaded area! According to the circuital law, this would imply that there is *no* magnetic field around the loop now, since there is no current going through the area, as drawn on the right-hand side.\n",

Here, we are looking down the $y$ axis, with the $+x$ axis towards the top of the figure. Thus, the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ is pointing either into or out of the picture, while the electric field ${\\vec E}$ points towards the top or bottom.\n",

The loop I am using here is centered at the point $k$ where I measure the magnetic field ${\\vec B}_k$, and has sides $2 \\Delta r_z$ (i.e. twice the separation between the field points). I chose this, because now I can use the *electric* fields at the neighboring points $k - 1$ and $k + 1$ to find the sum $\\sum_k {\\vec E}_k \\cdot \\Delta {\\vec \\ell}_k$.

    "So what are these equations telling us? If we look at the first one, it says that if the electric field magnitude increase with the index $k$ (i.e. increases with increasing $r_z$), then the magnetic field magnitude $B_k$ will *decrease* with time. On the other hand, if the electric field magnitude decreases with larger $k$, then the magnetic field is increasing in size. This may seem backwards, but it is exactly what we need to have a wave move in the $+z$ direction, or to the right in the pictures above. If you look at the right-hand side of one of the crests, then you want the magnetic field to increase as the crest is moving towards you (from the left); the field gets bigger as the crest comes from the left to the location you are looking at. If you are at the left-hand side of a crest, the field should be getting smaller, as the crest moves away from you, to the right.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson shows how electric and magnetic fields are really unified in a single idea called electromagnetism. As we saw, this is because Maxwell's equations tell us that if there is a non-conservative field of one type, that will lead to a change in flux for the other. For example, Faraday's law says that, if there is a non-conservative electric field around a closed loop, then there is a change in magnetic flux through the loop. The Ampere-Maxwell law says the same for a non-conservative magnetic field giving a changing electric flux. So, note the causation: one kind of non-oonservative field causes the other to change with time. This matches how we have talked about relations with quantities changing in time throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship between electric and magnetic fields is exactly what is necessary to have electromagnetic waves, combinations of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate at a fixed speed. In fact, the constants $\\mu_0$ and $\\epsilon_0$ in the equations gives exactly what this speed is! All electromagnetic waves will travel with this fixed speed $c$. Knowing the speed of light is constant throughout the Universe was a big conceptual leap for physics, and led directly to Einstein's theory of special relativity. More broadly, the roadmap provided by Maxwell's equations was eventually used as a guide to explain other fundamental forces in the Universe, such as the strong and weak nuclear forces, using a quantum mechanical framework. Unfortunately, the same is not yet true about gravitation, but this is an active area of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, what is presented in this lesson is just the tip of a broad area of physics, but the concepts here are deep and powerful ones. Hopefully, this brief overview gives you some idea of these basic ideas. And this summit of physics is a good place to end the class!\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define conservative and non-conservative fields.\n",
    "* Use the Ampere-Maxwell and Faraday laws to calculate the change in electric or magnetic flux, due to the appropriate non-conservative field.\n",
    "* Describe how electric and magnetic fields combine to give propagating waves."
