    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few lessons, you have seen how vectors are important when studying the motion of an object. The fundamental properties of motion -- position, velocity, and acceleration -- are all vectors. Thus, both their definitions, and the mathematical relationships between them, are vector equations. Even with the scalar kinematic equations, the vectors components of these quantities are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, up to this point, we have only worked with components of vectors. For eample, in the last lesson, free fall only dealt with motion along the $y$ axis. Suppose instead you are given the size and direction of a vector? An example would be saying the speed of a ship is 15.0 knots, and it is moving 30.0$^\\circ$ north of west. How can we write this in terms of components? Or, if we go the other way around, if I know the components of an acceleration, how can I find the magnitude and direction of this vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the purpose of this lesson -- to learn how to go back and forth between writing a vector in terms of components, and using magnitude and direction to describe the vector. This will use the mathematics of trigonometry heavily, so it is important you get a good grasp on how this process works. After this lesson, you should have all the basic relations needed to go from one description of a vector to another. Along the way, you will learn more about unit vectors. In particular, you will see how to find a unit vector pointing in the same direction as any given vector. Once we have this down, we can move on to projectile motion in [Lesson 08](proj-mot).\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to remember is the components of a vector are the sizes of the vector along *perpendicular* directions (recall the streets and avenues of Manhattan in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy)). This is why we use *right triangle* trigonometry, because the components are always going to be perpendicular. (You can be brave and use the law of cosines or sines if you know them, but you will quickly get bogged down by the time you try to add three vectors!)\n",

In other words, if we form a right triangle, with the hypotenuse given by the magnitude, and one of the angles coming from the vector direction, the $x$ and $y$ components of the vector will be the two sides of the right triangle. Before we go through that, though, we should talk about how directions are specified for vectors. There are a few ways you might see this. The first is to give an angle $\\theta$ between $0^\\circ$ and $360^\\circ$, and say the vector points at \"$\\theta$ degrees counterclockwise (or CCW) from the $+x$ axis\". This is often how you see angles given in math class, for example. However, you need to use this to create a right triangle, so you need to find an angle between $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$. This is where drawing a vector diagram is helpful, to figure out this angle. The process is shown in the figure below, for a vector pointing $240.^\\circ$ CCW from the $+x$ axis. Since the $-y$ axis is 270.$^\\circ$, and \"too far CCW around the circle\", we have to subtract $270.^\\circ - 240.^\\circ$ to get the remaining angle $\\theta$.

To do this, we need to import the trigonometric functions in vPython; these are the modules `sin` and `cos`. However, vPython does not use degrees as a unit of angle; instead, it uses **radians**. If you have never seen these before, it is an alternate (and probably more sensible!) angular unit, with one complete turn around the circumference defined as $2 \\pi$ radians. This means the conversion factor between degrees and radians is\n",

The program below includes two curves `xAxis` and `yAxis`, to show the $x$ and $y$ axes of the coordinate system. They also have labels `xLabel` and `yLabel` to show which one is which.
