    "Up to this point, we have used Kirchhoff's laws only as a conceptual basis for calculations. For example, it was the junction rule that told us the currents through resistors in series were all the same; similarly, it was the loop rule that justified why the voltages across resistors in parallel were identical. From this basis, we could derive the equivalence resistance for groups of resistors in series and parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many circuits where the resistors cannot be grouped in such a way; I will refer to these circuits as **complex circuits**. One example is known as the Wheatstone bridge, whose diagram is shown below. This is a simple circuit that can be used to measure the value of an unknown resistance by \"balancing\" the bridge, i.e. changing the resistance of one of the other resistors until the current flow through branch $AB$ is zero. Because of the way the resistors are connected, in general, none of them have the same current or voltage, so none are in series or parallel with each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another example is the one shown below, with two batteries in the circuit. Notice that, if either battery were replaced with a wire, then two of the resistors would be in parallel, and in series as a group with the third resistor. This example is actually a physically relevant one. Up to this point, we have usually assumed that the batteries we use are \"ideal\", that is, they have no internal resistance to current. Although realistic batteries will have little such internal resistance, it is not zero, and so solving situations like the one shown is important. This is the reason for the gray boxes in the circuit diagram -- each box represents a realistic battery, and these two batteries are connected  at both ends to a resistor. This might be the situation if you were using jumper cables to recharge the battery of a friend's car, which is why the batteries \"point\" in the same direction.\n",

    "In this lesson, we will study how to use Kirchhoff's laws to write down equations to solve for the currents and voltages for situations such as these. One part of the process will be to formalize how to write down equations from the loop rule. You may remember in Lesson 30 I talked about the high and low voltage sides of a circuit element; keeping track of this issue will be important. We also need to make a detour into the idea of *independent equations*, so we write down exactly the number of equations we require. Finally, we will do an example, and show some good tricks to solving the loop and junction rule equations.\n",

    "For now, let's assume that we are given a circuit diagram, along with arrows representing the currents through each branch of the circuit. We will come back to choosing these arrows later in the lesson. Writing down an equation from the junction rule is relatively straightfoward: simply add up the currents whose arrows point into the junction, and set this equal to the sum of the currents leaving the junction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Make sure you follow the branch!** Remember that a branch is made of circuit devices and wires that are all in series, so they have the same current. An arrow giving the current in the branch, that is drawn at one point of that branch, shows the direction of the current in the *whole* branch. I see many students not following the branch to the end, or ignoring the current coming into or out of a junction from a particular branch. Also, remember that the branch changes when you pass through a junction, so elements on different sides of a junction will have different currents."

    "### The loop rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop rule is more complicated conceptually, so I will go through this in a little detail. Remember from Lesson 30 that the \"loop\" in the loop rule is a path that you choose to move around the circuit, keeping track of the voltage changes as you pass through each circuit element. The loop can be either with the current direction or against it; often, the same loop will be both, for different branches of the circuit. Because this loop is chosen completely independently from the directions of the currents, when we find the voltage change of a circuit device, it is important to know both which way we are going around the path, as well as the properties of the device itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A battery is easier to consider, so I will start with it. Recall that the long line of a battery symbol refers to the high voltage side, while the short line is the low voltage side. So if, when traveling along the loop you choose, you go into the battery on the short line, and out the long line, there is an *increase* in voltage. Traveling in the opposite direction leads to a *decrease* in voltage. This is illustrated in the figures below for a battery with voltage $V$; notice that the direction of the current through the battery is irrelevant!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Voltage changes when traveling through a battery using the loop rule](../img/INT_AY20_MP3_L19_Fig04_Battery_volt_change.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving along the loop through a resistor, both the direction you move through the resistor *and* the direction of the current matter. A battery comes already with a high and low voltage side, but a resistor does not. Think of it using the hydraulic analogy -- a waterfall has a definite direction, but a water pipe does not. Either end of the pipe can be the place where the water comes into the pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current will enter into one side of the resistor, and the resistor will take some of the electrical energy of the charges to use for other purposes. The charges then leave the resistor out the other end, with less energy. If you think about what that means, the side of the resistor where the current comes in is the high voltage side, and where it leaves is the low voltage side. This is *dependent* on the current direction. I can take the same resistor, flip it around, and then the opposite side from before will be the high voltage side.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we can use Ohm's law to find the voltage change $V = IR$ due to a current $I$ and resistance $R$. The sign of the voltage change is given in the diagrams below, again depending on which way the current for that branch points relative to the direction you travel around the loop.\n",

This is the meeting point of three branches: $AB, AC,$ and $AD$. For two of these branches, the current arrows point away from the junction; these are the currents $I_4$ for $AC$ and $I_6$ for $AD$.

However, you have to be careful to include current $I_6$ as coming into $D$ along the branch $AD$. This branch is drawn as two \"sides\", but it only counts as one wire, since no other wire connects with it between $A$ and $D$. Thus, the junction rule at $D$ is\n",

    "Next we turn to the loop rule equations for the circuit. To help find the voltage differences, I have taken the same circuit diagram from before, but labeled the high voltage sides of each circuit element with a '$+$', and the low voltage side with a '$-$'. As I talked about above, for a battery, this just depends on how the battery is drawn, but for resistors, it depends on the direction of the current arrow.\n",

Starting at $A$ and taking each element, one at a time, we first pass through $R_3$. This resistor is on the branch with current $I_4$, and we are moving in the same direction as the current. Thus, the path enters the high voltage side (the '$+$') and leaves the low voltage side (the '-'), and the change in voltage across $R_3$ will be $-I_4 R_3$.\n",

For the branch $AD$, this means I get the same results as the last loop, but with opposite signs. Thus, the change in voltage going from $A$ to $D$ along the bottom is $-I_6 R_4 - V_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going along the branch $DB$, there is not a circuit element here, so there is no change in voltage. Notice this means that the junctions $B$ and $D$ have the same voltage.

This would have the advantage of eliminating the current $I_3$, but I will leave the circuit diagram as it is for this example.\n",

This is a feature, not a bug -- it tells us that the physical direction of the current is in the opposite direction to the arrow direction chosen. Much like we can chose either up or down as the $+y$ direction, the arrows are just a mathematical choice. If the equations give us a negative number, then the current simply flows in the opposite direction to the chosen arrow.\n",

    "## Independent equations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just saw, using Kirchhoff's laws entails writing down equations resulting from the loop and junction rules. One key part is deciding how many of each kind to use; as we will see, there are actually more equations than we actually want! Knowing the correct number of equations gets into the issue of *independent equations*. To motivate this idea, let's start with an example from geometry.\n",
    "\n",

In particular, if we use the method we outlined above, then solving for $x$ in the second equation and substituting into the first simply gives $0 = 0$. Obviously, the problem is that both equations in the second set describe the same line -- the first equation is now -5 times the second. The two equations give exactly the same information about the points $(x, y)$. When we have equations like these, we call them dependent equations. When we have a situation like the first set of equations, these equations are known as **independent equations**. Each equation gives new information about the solution we are looking for (the intersection point). Said differently, in a set of independent equations, we cannot write any particular equation in terms of the others. Here, for the second set, one equation is simply the multiple of the other, but the relationships can be more complicated than that.\n",

    "Now let's return to Kirchhoff's laws and analyzing a circuit diagram. If a circuit has $J$ junctions, then there are only $J - 1$ independent junction equations.

Notice this does not mean a *specific* equation, just that *any one* of them can be discarded, and the rest are sufficient.\n",

    "By the way, it is fairly easy to prove that $J - 1$ is the number of independent junction equations. To do this, take a circuit and pick a junction at random.

Taken as a whole, all of the other junctions will have the same currents, but now it will be the $N_{in}$ that are going *out of* the rest of the circuit, and the $N_{out}$ going *into* it. The sum of the junction equations for the rest of the current will then be the same as the equation for the junction we picked. \n",

Similarly, the currents $I_4$ and $I_5$ going *into* junction $F$ come *out of* $D$ and $E$ as a group (here, just $E$).

    "Kirchhoff's laws provide the equations you can use to analysis any resistor circuit. They do not require any special conditions on the connections between resistors, or the number of batteries in the circuit. Although solving them by hand can be onerous, it should give you a good intuition about how such a process works. In a workplace application, such as designing circuits for a living, there are matrix methods to solve these using a computer. Do this yourself, though, develops your sixth sense about when the computer is spitting out garbage solutions!\n",

    "The next lesson will introduce another type of circuit element, the capacitor. Although it shares some superficial similarities with a battery, it has key differences as well. The interaction of resistors and capacitors in a circuit can be interesting as well, leading to currents that change in time.\n",
