    "Everyone has heard of the famous experiment where Galileo Galilei dropped two masses off the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in order to show that the force of gravity accelerated all objects equally. Unfortunately, this story is probably not true! What he did instead is more interesting, and leads to actual mathematical relationships dealing with acceleration and gravity. His experiment is a prime example of how the inclined planes we will discuss in this lesson were important to our greater understanding of physics. As described in the video linked below, he rolled a ball down a groove at an angle to the horizontal, and saw how the ball would accelerate."

    "We will study this example, and others like it. In this lesson, there will be the conjunction of several topics we have talked about before: the scalar product, Newton's laws of motion, and the gravitational, frictional, and normal forces. As detailed before, the scalar product allows us to divide a vector into pieces along a set of directions. However, instead of the usual \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" directions (or $x, y$, and $z$ axes), we will use the directions \"parallel\" and \"perpendicular\" to the ramp or incline. This, along with Newton's 2nd law, allows us to find the equation of motion for an object moving along the ramp. There will always be a gravitational force, and the normal force due to the ramp itself; there will also be the possibility of a frictional force from the interaction between the object and the inclined plane.\n",

    "We now have enough mathematical and conceptual tools to look at objects moving along a ramp or incline. Below is a brief description of how we will go about this. In [Lesson 11 (scalar product)](scal-prod), we defined the scalar product between two vectors. Then we showed that one useful property it had was identifying vectors that were perpendicular to each other. In this lesson, we will put this into practice by defining two unit vectors along a surface -- one vector ${\\vec e}_{||}$ will be parallel to the surface, and the other unit vector ${\\vec e}_\\perp$ will be perpendicular to the surface. Since, in general, objects on an inclined plane move along the surface, the motion should be written solely in terms of the parallel unit vector ${\\vec e}_{||}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game plan for this lesson will be the following. First, we will revisit the motion of an object along a horizontal surface. We are used to thinking of this in terms of the unit vectors ${\\hat x}$ and ${\\hat y}$, i.e. \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\". However, it will help us later to rewrite these as two unit vectors that are *parallel* and *perpendicular* to the horizontal surface. After we have done that, then we are ready to consider inclined planes. Instead of having a horizontal surface, the surface will now be at an angle $\\theta$ to the horizontal. This will change the definitions of our parallel and perpendicular unit vectors ${\\vec e}_{||}$ and ${\\vec e}_\\perp$, as well as some of the force vector components in terms of them.\n",

When you run the program below, it uses this function to put the block on the ramp. To start with, the block and ramp are horizontal; you will add the code needed to have both the ramp and block tilt at the desired angle. The function `init()` only returns the object `block`, since the ramp will be stationary for the entire simulation; only the block will (eventually) change position.

    "*Answer:* The coefficient of static friction only depends on the two surface moved relative to each other, so this does not change. As the angle increases, the component $F_{g, ||}$ of the gravitational force along the ramp will increase in size, while the normal force will decrease in size. It might help to think of the extreme case, when the board is straight up. Then, all of gravity points along the board, while the normal force is essentially zero.\n",

    "As another example, let's see how we can experimentally determine the coefficient of static friction $\\mu_s$ for a substance with a simple measurement. Suppose we have a block sitting at rest on a ramp, and it stays at rest, because the force of static friction is enough to keep it in place. This means that static friction has a magnitude less than or equal to its maximum value:\n",

    "Thus, the coefficient of static friction $\\mu_s$ determines a maximum angle $\\theta_s = \\tan^{-1} \\mu_s$ known as the **angle of repose**. If the angle of the ramp is greater than this angle $\\theta_s$, then static friction is *not* enough to keep the block in place, and it will slide down the ramp. On the other hand, if the incline angle is less than $\\theta_s$, then a block started at rest will remain at rest on the ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of this is that piles of a given material will always have a slope less than a particular value. If you watch the video linked below, you will see sand poured onto an existing sand pile. The angle of the pile with respect to the horizontal will never get to be more than about 35 degrees or so. If this does happen, the sand at the top will slide down, until the angle is again below the angle of repose. So, you can see that the coefficient of static friction for sand on sand is about $\\tan 35^\\circ$, or around 0.700."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduced the ideas involved for objects moving on a ramp or inclined plane. As you saw in the lesson overview section, this problem has a long history in physics! It is also a nice way to show the interrelationship between the gravitational and normal forces -- the size of the normal force, compared to the object's weight, can be easily changed by altering the ramp angle. The normal force will have a different magnitude for any given angle choice, showing how this force can vary, depending on what is necessary to keep the object from going through the ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also brought together the ideas of inclined planes and friction (from [Lesson 12](force-prob)). This should give you some practice in applying Newton's second law to a situation with multiple forces acting on an object. In particular, with an applied force included, this force can have components both parallel and perpendicular to the ramp. If the applied force has a perpendicular part, the normal force can change, thus altering the frictional force parallel to the ramp. Therefore, this is a situation where what is happening in one direction can affect the motion in a perpendicular direction. This will be the generic situation for force problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the normal force acting on an object.\n",
    "* Write down the Newton's 2nd law equations for an object moving on an inclined plane."
