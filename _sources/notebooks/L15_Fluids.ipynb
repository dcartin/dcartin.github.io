    "Anything that you do in the sea services depends fundamentally on the properties of fluids. If you fly aircraft, you maintain altitude because of the lift on the wings or blades of your vehicle. The depth your submarine cruises at is a result of how much air versus water the boat has in its ballast tanks. Whether you are a sailor or a marine, your ship stays on the water because a naval architect has ensured the ship is buoyant and maintains its stability in choppy weather. Air and water are two prominent examples of fluids, but there are many others you can probably think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that \"buoyant force\" refers to the total force a fluid exerts on an object; however, this force results from the difference in pressure on the top and bottom of the object. The pressure on the bottom is almost always greater, giving an upwards buoyant force. Therefore, this lesson starts with the idea of pressure, and builds on that to develop the buoyant force. It was the great thinker Archimedes who came up with a relatively simple way to find the buoyant force, over two thousand years ago. If you use the resulting Archimedes' principle, you will have an able guide to understand situations with fluids.\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define pressure and density.\n",
    "* State the density of fresh water.\n",
    "* State the value of standard atmospheric pressure in SI units.\n",
    "* Explain Pascal's principle.\n",

    "Historically, one of the more important ideas in physics from the 18th and 19th centuries is the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases), which explains many of the properties of a gas by the simple model of assuming the gas is made of very small particles moving at random speeds. A good simulation to explore this model, and to review how it accounts for the various gas laws, is given below. You can also explore the distribution of kinetic energies for all of the particles in the gas, including the case where there are two different kinds of particle involved."

Or how you \"feel\" this push? It turns out your skin actually measures the amount of force over a given area, not the absolute size of the force. So, if you exert the same force, but over a larger portion of your body, it does not feel as painful as if you apply the same force to a small area.\n",

Thus, for a denser fluid, the weight would be larger, even if nothing else changed, since there is more mass above the point. Similarly, if you take the container of fluid to another planet, with a different gravitational field, the weight will change for that reason. Finally, if you change the depth of the point you are measuring, there will be more or less fluid above that point, giving a different pressure reading. Notice that moving horizontally will *not* change the pressure, since the amount of fluid above the point has not changed.\n",

The weight of fluid above that area will be due to all the mass above it. To find this mass, we can think of it as forming a cylinder above the area $A$, with a height the same as the depth $h$. Thus, the volume of this cylinder is $Ah$. We can write the mass $m$ of the fluid in terms of the fluid density $\\rho_{fl}$ as\n",

In particular, the World Meteorological Organization defines a standard atmosphere as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...a hypothetical vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature, pressure and density which, by international agreement, is roughly representative of year-round, midlatitude conditions. Typical usages are as a basis for pressure altimeter calibrations, aircraft performance calculations, aircraft and rocket design, ballistic tables, and meteorological diagrams.\n",

    "I will go through the basic assumptions of the model, then you will try your hand at finding the temperature at a given height using the model. The United States is currently using the [US Standard Atmosphere model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere), last updated in 1976.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, the model assumes *hydrostatic equilibrium*; this is just a fancy way of saying the same pressure-height equation we were using earlier. The only difference is that, since we are now going *up* in the fluid (i.e. the atmosphere!), it is more convenient to use the height $r_z$, instead of a depth $h$. Since we are increasing our height, rather than going downward in depth, we need to take this difference into account by using $\\Delta r_z = -\\Delta h$. Again, the minus sign comes from the fact we are moving upward in the fluid, not downward. Thus, our first equation relates pressure $P$ to the distance $r_z$ above sea level, or\n",

Notice we are using degrees kelvin, or K, for our temperature measurements. To put this in a more helpful form, let's write this in terms of gas density, instead of volume, since it is density that appears in the pressure-height equation above. Using the fact that $n$ is the mass $M$ of gas divided by the molar mass $m_{mol}$ of the gas, then with $M = \\rho V$, after some algebra we can solve for density to get\n",

    "As mentioned above, for a stationary fluid, the shape of the container does not matter when measuring the pressure at a given depth. Let's explore this notion some more. We can think of the fluid as composed of imaginary bags, each of which is pressing against its neighbors, or the container walls. In equilibrium, these forces will balance out, and the fluid remains stationary. If they did *not* balance out, then the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" would give it an acceleration until the forces *did* balance out, and equilibrium is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose there is an outside force acting on the fluid. This could be something like a piston pressing down on the fluid, or even a change in atmospheric pressure above a lake as a storm front comes into the area. This results in a change in the force on the top of the fluid. The \"bags of fluid\" will then rearrange themselves to account for this different force, until the fluid is again in equilibrium. Every change in pressure from outside the fluid will result in the same change in pressure everywhere inside the fluid as well, an idea known as **Pascal's principle**. One consequence is that the ressure of a stationary enclosed fluid at one vertical height is the same pressure at a different point with the same vertical height. If it were not, the fluid would flow until the pressures are equalized, and the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" is now zero.\n",

Now let's raise the gauges upward, one of either side of the tube, so that they are always in the same depth of water inside the tube. Because they are in the same fluid at the same depth, they will still read the same pressure. This is true *until* the gauge going up the right side crosses into the oil; because the oil has a different density, the pressures will now be different on either side of the tube.
