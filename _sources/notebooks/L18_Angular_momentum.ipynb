    "In [Lesson 11](lin-mom-Newton), the idea of linear momentum was introduced. Remember that this quantity is a good one to use when thinking about the inertia of an object. Linear momentum stays the same unless acted on by a net force (Newton's 1st law); the size of the change in linear momentum is related to the size of this net force (Newton's 2nd law). Thus, we could talk about the conservation of linear momentum when a system was isolated, i.e. no *external* forces acted on the system. Collisions were a good example of using this conservation principle to understand the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go through an \"angular\" or \"rotational\" version of momentum. However, we will see that many of the same ideas hold here as they do with linear momentum -- angular momentum changes due to the action of a net torque (or \"rotational force\"), while angular momentum is conserved in isolated systems. Perhaps surprisingly, this conservation of angular momentum works even if the object moves in a straight line! As long as we have a reference point (the ${\\vec r} = 0$ location), we can calculate the angular momentum of an object around that point, regardless of what kind of motion the object has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum is very important in dealing with my favorite force: the gravitational force. Specifically, we can use conservation of angular momentum to talk about the orbit of one object around another (e.g. the Moon and the Earth). Indeed, it can be used for any central force, such as the spring force or the electrostatic force. Later on, we will also have discuss the principle of mechanical energy conservation, and between these two conservation principles, we can calculate quite a bit about an orbiting body. We will see a hint of that by the end of this lesson.\n",

Newton's second law then relates the net external force to the change in the system's linear momentum.\n",

    "In a similar manner, angular momentum ${\\vec L}$ is a measure of the rotational motion of an object about a chosen axis. Much like Newton's 2nd law says changes in linear momentum are due to net forces, there is a corresponding rotational version of this equation.

    "The attentive reader may notice that I have tried to pull a fast one on you! Before, I said that conservation of linear momentum in the absence of net external forces is a re-statement of the principle of inertia (Newton's 1st law). However, inertia only deals with constant *velocity*. As we saw when we discussed uniform circular motion, there is no corresponding \"rotational\" version of Newton's 1st law -- in other words, objects do not have a natural tendency to rotate, since this requires a centripetal force acting on the object. However, it turns out that the answer to this riddle deals with the *symmetry* of physics. One (slightly strange) way to say this is that if I took the entire Universe and rotated it, the laws of physics would be exactly the same -- no one would notice! Modern physics is now based heavily on this idea of symmetry, based on the ideas of [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), as discussed in the following videos linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf0zCaqrwM), and more in-depth [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ERSb06dOg).\n",

You are asked to find the magnitude of the angular momentum for the mass around $P$. This is the situation in the left-hand diagram, where the velocity and position vectors are shown. At the mass, the line of the position vector is extended (this is the dashed line at the top), and the angle $\\theta$ between the two vectors ${\\vec r}$ and ${\\vec v}$ is shown.

How would you solve the problem then? Looking at the middle picture, you can see that the position vector ${\\vec r}$ has been broken up into its two components. One component $r_{||}$ is in the same direction as the velocity ${\\vec v}$, so it points parallel to the dotted line. The other component $r_\\perp$ is perpendicular to this line. If you look back at the left-hand diagram, you will see that there is a second dotted line, passing through the point $P$, parallel to the motion of the mass. The two angles $\\theta$ are thus the same, since they are related by two parallel lines (the dotted lines) crossed by the same transversal (the position vector). This allows us to find the length of $r_\\perp$ as\n",

This component $r_\\perp$ is a special one, so it has its own name -- the **moment arm**: the shortest distance from the ${\\vec r} = 0$ point to the line through the velocity vector of the object.

    "Obviously, point masses are not the only types of object that occur in physics. As mentioned above, for extended objects, we can use conservation of angular momentum to find, for example, the rotational speed of an object. However, this depends on defining a quantity known as the *moment of inertia*. Much like mass is a measure of an object's resistance to linear motion, the moment of inertia is the same for rotational motion. However, we will not define this quantity because we are focusing on the angular momentum of point masses. You may see the moment of inertia in a future physics class, when you are dealing with the rotation of an extended object."

Thus, the ball will move along the line $r_y = +2$ at constant speed $v = 1$. The ball is also given a mass `M`, defined at the beginning of the program. In addition, there are two arrows in the simulation: a yellow arrow showing the constant velocity ${\\vec v}$ of the ball, and a cyan arrow showing the changing ball position ${\\vec r}$. Run the program, and note how ${\\vec r}$ and ${\\vec v}$ change with time.\n",

Also, set its lower vertical axis limit as `ymin = 0`. Label the two axes with proper titles using `xtitle` and `ytitle` (including units!). Immediately below this, create a blue curve `angMomCurve` using the graph `angMomGraph`.

Let's see why that is true; this will recount some of our discussion from [Lesson 16](UCM:cent-force). To start, the ball is moving perpendicular to its position vector, so the velocity has a zero radial component. Then, we can compare the net force on the ball to the necessary centripetal force needed to keep it at that radius. Plugging in the default numbers from the program above, we get\n",

We will now use angular momentum to find the speed of the ball at this radius. The key point is to realize that, just like at the maximum radius, when the ball is at its minimum radius, it has stopped moving towards the center. Thus, the radial component of the velocity $v_r = 0$; you can see these are the points where the red line passes through a value of zero.

Conservation of angular momentum says that the perpendicular velocity component $v_\\perp$ is larger as the radius gets smaller. We can verify this by plugging in the numbers to get $v_{f, \\perp} = 3.72$ m/s, larger than the initial speed of 3.00 m/s.

Each pair of physical quantities are related, but the addition of the position vector ${\\vec r}$ and the vector product are an extra element that you need to consider. The analogy goes on to relate net torque and angular momentum with the rotational version of Newton's second law (just as we saw in [Lesson 11](lin-mom-Newton) between net force and linear momentum).\n",
