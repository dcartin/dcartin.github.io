    "Suppose you have two vectors, and you want a mathematical operation that combines them to get a new quantity. By this, I mean that it doesn't matter how you choose your coordinate system -- the answer for these operations is independent of your choice. It turns out that, in *any* dimension, there are only two ways to do this, so that everyone agrees on the answer! The first of these is something we have already seen, the scalar product ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$ of two vectors ${\\vec A}$ and ${\\vec B}$, defined in [Lesson 09](scal-prod). If I use the unit vectors ${\\hat x}$ and ${\\hat y}$ (horizontal and vertical), while you are working with a ramp, so you use the unit vectors ${\\hat e}_{||}$ and ${\\hat e}_\\perp$ (parallel and perpendicular) matching the ramp. It turns out that if you calculate the scalar product of two vectors using either possibility for the unit vector notation, you get exactly the same answer. Hopefully this makes sense, because the scalar product only depends on (1) the size of each vector, and (2) the angle between them. These values do not depend on how we orient our coordinate system. The scalar product was helpful in [Lesson 14 (inclined planes)](ramp) in finding a new set of unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to an inclined plane; it will also appear in [Lesson 19](work-KE) for the definition of the work done by a (constant) force.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we look at the only other way to define a quantity that is again the same, regardless of the coordinates used. This new mathematical operation is known as the *vector product* (or \"cross product\"). Like the name suggests, this will take two vectors and spit out a third vector. However, it will also have a geometric interpretation as well. It is this viewpoint that assures us that the vector product is independent of the coordinate choice.\n",

    "## Rotational quantities as vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector product can appear to be odd at first glance, so before we get into its definition, let's take a moment to see why it is useful. For now, it is going to be needed to deal with objects that are rotating. Unlike much of what we have done up to this point, rotations are inherently three-dimensional, so the physics and math we use needs to reflect this. First, we consider what a rotation does. Every rotation consists of two aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a *rotational axis* about which the rotation occurs\n",
    "1. a plane *perpendicular* to the axis, where all vectors in the plane are rotated around the axis (either CW or CCW)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows how these attributes are related for a rotation axis along the $z$ axis. These two aspects can be combined mathematically to a vector description of the rotation. Suppose we look at a small change $\\Delta \\theta$ in angle counterclockwise about the $+z$ axis. This rotates vectors in the $x-y$ plane. In other words, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of every point will change because of this rotation, while the $z$ coordinate will remain the same. In the pictures below, the $x-y$ plane is in the page, while the $z$ axis points out at you.\n",

    "Every rotation axis has a plane perpendicular to it, where the rotation occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin} Only small angles allowed\n",
    "This only works for \"small\" rotations $\\Delta \\theta$. For larger rotations, you need to apply group theory from mathematics -- a very interesting topic and the basis of a lot of modern physics, but something we don't have time for!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this notion, we get that \"rotation\" = \"axis + angle\". Thus, we can define a vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\theta}$ associated with a rotation of $\\Delta \\theta$ around an axis. Again, in the right-hand picture above, the plane is in the page, and the vector ${\\vec \\theta}$ is pointing out at you. There are rotational versions of velocity and acceleration -- namely, the angular velocity ${\\vec \\omega}$ (Greek letter \"omega\") and the angular acceleration ${\\vec \\alpha}$ (Greek letter \"alpha\"). These are defined as you would expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec \\omega} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec \\theta}}{\\Delta t} \\qquad\n",
    "    {\\vec \\alpha} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec \\omega}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The directions of these vectors is defined similar to that of $\\Delta {\\vec \\theta}$, perpendicular to the plane of rotation. Although thinking of an angular velocity or acceleration in a plane in terms of a vector perpendicular to the plane is strange at first, this will help explain many of the properties of rotational motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much as there are rotational versions of the quantities displacement, velocity, and acceleration, there are also rotational versions of a force. These \"torques\" that produce angular accelerations, changing the angular velocity of an object. Suppose you have a rotating disk, as shown in the first picture below. The disk is rotating counterclockwise at a certain number of rotations per second, or its angular speed. This information (\"CCW\" + rotation rate) can be encoded in the *vector* ${\\vec \\omega}_i$. Its size gives the angular speed, and its direction tells us the rotation is counterclockwise. We will come back to the relationship between the direction of ${\\vec \\omega}_i$ and the rotation direction later in the lesson.\n",

    "Now, let's have a force ${\\vec F}$ acting on the outside edge of the disk, asw shown in the middle figure. This force will produce a torque ${\\vec \\tau}$ (Greek letter \"tau\") on the object, changing its angular velocity ${\\vec \\omega}$ in size. For now, I will talk about torque conceptually; in [Lesson 18 (angular momentum)](ang-mom:torque), I will define it more properly. In this situation, the torque is acting to increase the angular speed of the disk, i.e. the number of rotations per second is getting larger. Thus, the angular velocity vector will change from ${\\vec \\omega}_i$ to ${\\vec \\omega}_f$, where the two vectors are in the same direction, but ${\\vec \\omega}_f$ has a larger magnitude. A torque can also decrease the magnitude of the angular velocity, as shown in the next diagram.\n",

    "The vector product operation is inherently three-dimensional, so it may be difficult sometimes to see what is going on. Because of this, we are going to see what the vector product of two vectors looks like *before* we get into the mathematical definition. Hopefully doing it this way will increase your intuition of why the vector product is defined the way it is. As with the scalar product, there is a module in vPython that calculates the vector product for you. This module is known as `cross`, and its use is shown in the program below. Here, the same two vectors ${\\vec A}$ and ${\\vec B}$ saw when introducing the scalar product in [Lesson 09](scal-prod) are defined, then their vector product ${\\vec A} \\times {\\vec B}$ is calculated.\n",
