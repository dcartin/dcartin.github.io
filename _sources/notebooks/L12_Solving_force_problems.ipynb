    "We have started with the basic definitions of momentum, and used it in Newton's laws of motion to consider the collision of objects. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of some of the important aspects of forces -- forces are due to an interaction between two objects, and over a time interval will change the momentum of each of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many more forces that we have not considered. I am sure that, after a moment's thought, you can make a long list of forces acting on objects. A few forces we will discuss over the coming lessons are friction, buoyancy, and gravity. Because these forces can have different properties, it is important to develop a standard way of combining these forces together to find the motion of the object they act on. This recipe is what is covered in this lesson. In particular, we will look at *free body diagrams* as a visual way of finding the correct Newton's 2nd law equation of a particular system.\n",

    "There is a standard *method* for solving force problems, but there is not a standard *equation*. Every time you have forces involved in a situation, you should start with a free body diagram and Newton's 2nd law. But the equation you derive from Newton's 2nd law will be different in each case! This is because the forces may be different, or the directions they act in may change. You will have to think through what is affecting the system, but always using the force equations to do so. This lesson will help to build that intuition within you.\n",

    "One of the convenient facts about the Universe is that you can solve for the overall motion of a complicated system by considering only a few pieces of information. We have seen this before in previous lessons -- for example, how a system of multiple objects can be thought of as a single point, moving along with the center of mass velocity of the system. We will build on this when considering forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can simplify things quite a bit, it makes sense to represent the situation for a system by drawing only those pieces of information that are required. This leads to the idea of a free body diagram. A **free body diagram** (abbreviated FBD) is a picture of the forces acting on a system, a way of succinctly summarizing the forces acting on a system, a single object, or at a single point. We will use these as a thinking aid when solving the equations of Newton's 2nd law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are eliminating any non-essential information in a free body diagram, only the force vectors, and the angles needed to find their components, will be included. This allows for the possibility that a lot of forces are acting on the system at once.\n",

    "Here, a monkey hanging off of a vine. Obviously, the force of gravity is acting downward on the monkey, so that means there is a like downward force on the vine at point $B$. This bends the vine, so at the monkey's hand, two tension forces are acting, one each to the left and right. Thus, the hand is where multiple forces are acting at once. The monkey will remain stationary only if these three forces add up to zero as *vectors*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented in the free body diagram to the right of the illustration. Because we are interested in maintaining equilibrium, the FBD is drawn at the point where the monkey's hand is grabbing the vine. The three forces acting at that point are then represented as vectors, pointing away from the dot indicating the position of the hand. This FBD shows all the information needed to write down the Newton's 2nd law equations for that position.\n",

    "## The tension force\n",
    "\n",
    "If something like a rope or string (or a vine!) is attached to an object, and then pulled on, that object will experience a **tension** force. This force will act at the point of contact between the rope and the object, and point in the direction along the rope at this contact point. So really, this is a type of applied force, and its magnitude can change, depending on how hard the rope is pulled on. You can imagine a tug-of-war, where the winner is determined by who can pull hardest; this can change, depending on who is working the rope.\n",

    "## The gravitational force\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about how to calculate the gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$, it is important to talk first about terminology. On Earth, we frequently use the terms \"mass\" and \"weight\" interchangeably, and this is not too far off. Since the gravitational field is roughly constant everywhere on the surface of the Earth, then the mass and weight of an object will always be proportional.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is an important conceptual distinction that this glosses over. When we say **mass**, we are referring to the amount of \"stuff\" an object has. This is a fixed property, as long as the object is not split into pieces. Another way to say this is that mass is the measure of inertia -- as we saw with Newton's 2nd law, for the *same* net force, an object with larger mass will have a *smaller* resulting acceleration. More massive objects are harder to move.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different that the weight of an object. **Weight** is the gravitational force on an object. So, unlike mass (which is a scalar), weight is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction. On the Earth's surface, the weight is always acting towards the center of the Earth, which is why we usually don't mention it when state our weight. As we will see shortly, it depends on the object's mass, but it also depends on the gravitational field. Since weight is a force, we will use the symbol ${\\vec F}_g$ for it. I will use \"weight\" and \"gravitational force\" as synonyms, so remember that weight is a vector, not a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in [Lesson 05 (acceleration and free fall)](accel), the gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ was described as the strength of the gravitational influence of an object on everything around it. Now that we are talking about forces, we can be more explicit in what this means. Once you know what ${\\vec g}$ is at the location of an object with mass $m$, then the gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$ on that object is given by\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this now explains something else said in Lesson 05: if gravity is the only force acting on the object, then its acceleration is the same as the gravitational field. You can see this by using Newton's 2nd law. Since the mass $m$ is in free fall, then the sum of the force is just ${\\vec F}_g$:\n",

    "If you have some discomfort with Newton's first law of motion, it's probably because of the widespread presence of frictional forces in our everyday lives. Whenever we roll a ball along a table, the ball will eventually stop, not because that is the \"natural\" motion of all objects, but because of friction between the ball and the table. This was one of the difficult mental leaps that had to be made to go from the thoughts of Aristotle and the ancient Greeks, to the modern viewpoint on physics: motion stops because there are forces present that cause this stop, *not* because the \"natural state\" of an object is always at rest. This flip between viewpoints allows us to describe in detail the forces that cause motion to change, rather than throwing up our hands and saying it's the way things are.\n",

    "### Two types of friction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are rearranging the furniture in your living room, and decide you want to move your couch. You give it a push to slide it along the carpet in the room. To make things definite, let's make it a couch with a weight of 2.00 kN, and you start out by applying a force of 200. N to the couch. It doesn't move, so you push harder with 400. N. It still doesn't move, so you push with 600. N. Still doesn't move. You activate those honed muscles of yours and push with 800. N, which is finally enough to get the couch to move. Not only does it move, but it starts accelerating across the living room! So, you push with only 600. N, and (unlike before), the couch now moves at a constant velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you can think of some situation like this, where you have to apply a force to get something to start moving. Once you do get it moving, you need less force to *keep* it moving. This shows that there are two separate types of frictional force. The **static frictional force** acts on an object when it is stationary relative to the surface it is sitting on. Notice that they may be moving together -- think of a crate in the flatbed of a pickup truck, for example. The **kinetic frictional force** acts on an object moving relative to the surface it is on. This may be due to the object moving on a stationary surface, or the other way around. The magnitude of the kinetic frictional force is usally less than that of the static frictional force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the couch in the example above starts moving, then only the kinetic frictional force is acting on it. Before that, however, your applied force is opposed by the *static* frictional force. Note how the type of frictional force changed! As you increased the applied force, the static frictional force matches it, at least up to a point. Beyond that maximum, though, friction was not strong enough to prevent the couch from moving, and now the kinetic friction was involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, da Vinci, Amontons, Coulomb, and others started a detailed study of the properties of the friction force. Their model of friction, described in this lesson, has two basic properties.\n",

    "1. The direction of the frictional force ${\\vec F}_{fr}$ is always opposing the motion of an object, or the potential motion, if the object is at rest.\n",
    "1. The magnitude $F_{fr}$ of the frictional force on an object on a surface is proportional to the normal force due to the surface, acting on the object. The constant of proportionality is known as the coefficient of friction, and given by the symbol $mu$ (\"mu\").\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about these in more detail, starting with the direction. Think again to the example mentioned earlier of a crate in a flatbed truck. As the truck drives along, if the flatbed's surface were completely smooth, the crate would have no horizontal force on it, and it would slide backwards. To keep the crate in place, the static frictional force acts opposite to this motion, in the direction the truck is moving. This is what I mean by opposing the potential motion of the object. Thus, it is actually the frictional force moving the crate forward! Think about that the next time you go for a walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the magnitude, since the force of friction is always proportional to the normal force, then it makes sense to look at the ratio of the frictional and normal forces; this will be the constant $\\mu$ mentioned above. Thus, the coefficient $\\mu$ is the ratio of the two magnitudes, or\n",

There will be a **coefficient of static friction** $\\mu_s$ and a **coefficient of kinetic friction** $\\mu_k$ for each such surface pair. These coefficients must be measured experimentally, by going into the lab and moving the two surfaces against each other.\n",

Specifically, the static frictional force would change, since you altered your applied force. Thus, the force of static friction will actually have a *range* of values, up to some maximum static frictional force.

    "We are now beginning to use force methods to solve problems. This lesson introduced this technique, and started with the tension, gravitational, normal, and frictional forces as examples to see how it works. Over the course of the next few lessons, we will add on additional forces, thus allowing us to look at more complicated situations. The basic ideas from this lesson will hold: the basic technique is to start with an FBD, and derive the appropriate force equations using Newton's 2nd law. This should be your standard practice!\n",
