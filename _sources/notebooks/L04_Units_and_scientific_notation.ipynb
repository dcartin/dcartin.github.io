    "Sometimes it is the most ordinary things that can be important. One of these are the units you will use to explain what a given number means. If I tell you the distance is \"5\", what does that mean: 5 centimeters? 5 kilometers? 5 light-years? Those are very different measures of a length -- the first would be the life's journey of a tiny bacteria, the second a nice run for the day, and the last is roughly the distance from the Sun to the nearest star system.\n",

    "\n",
    "**SI units** (\"SI\" for the French \"Systeme International\") are a system of units designed to simplify the process of measurement as much as possible. These units, also known as \"metric units\", were first developed during the French Revolution, but have come to be a system used globally. They are convenient, since conversions between many units for the same type of quantity use a power of 10. Here is a table of the **base** units we will use this year. **Dimension** is the basic physical quantity that is being measured, while the **unit** is how the dimension is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension        | SI unit (abbrev.) |\n",
    "|------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| length           | meter (m)         |\n",
    "| mass\t           | kilogram (kg)     |\n",
    "| time             | second (s)        |\n",
    "| electric current | ampere (A)        |\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between dimension and unit, notice that I can measure the same *dimension* in different *units* -- time can be measured in seconds, hours, or years. In addition, we will later built up other units from combinations of these basic units (for example, velocity is measured in meters per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you have a good sense of what a second is, but maybe not the same intuition for a meter or a kilogram. My height is a little bit less than two meters; this is roughly the same as the distance from fingertip to fingertip when I fully stretch out my arms. A two liter bottle of soda has a mass of two kilograms. Notice that the base unit of mass is the *kilogram*, not the gram! The original definition started with the gram, but then it was decided to be too small of a unit, so they made the kilogram the base unit. Interestingly enough, the definitions of all the base SI units was recently changed, to make them more accurate as well as more accesible to scientists around the world; you can find out more at the [SI units page](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition) created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these units are not always so useful. For example, what is the typical diameter of an atom? What is the mass of a new Ford-class aircraft carrier? The diameter would be a really *small* number, and the mass a very *large* one. To built up better units, we can glue a **prefix** onto the front of the basic unit. Some common prefixes are listed in the table below; this list -- with the power, prefix, and abbrevation, must be *memorized*!\n",
    "\n",
    "| Power     | Prefix\t| Abbreviation |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n",
    "| $10^{-9}$ | nano\t\t| n\t\t\t   |\n",
    "| $10^{-6}$ | micro\t\t| $\\mu$\t\t   |\n",
    "| $10^{-3}$ | milli\t\t| m\t\t\t   |\n",
    "| $10^{-2}$ | centi\t\t| c\t\t\t   |\n",
    "| $10^3$\t| kilo\t\t| k\t\t\t   |\n",
    "| $10^6$\t| mega      | M            |\n",
    "| $10^9$    | giga      | G            |\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can see that it may be more appropriate to use nanometers (instead of meters) for the size of an atom, or gigagrams (instead of kilograms) for the aircraft carrier's mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Don't make prefixes difficult\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "The one error I see students make over and over is to use the prefix table above incorrectly. Often they try to \"think too much\" about it, and thus flip the sign of the exponent in the power of ten. Here's how you should think of this: *the prefix is the same as the power of ten*. In other words, you can replace one with the other, and not change anything. Thus, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "1 milligram = $10^{-3}$ grams\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the \"milli\" is replaced by \"$10^{-3}$\" to get an equivalent amount.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert between one such unit to another, it is very helpul to use the method of *railroad tracks*. This method does a lot of the thinking for you. I often see students try to do something different, and it usually ends up in a mess. Railroad tracks are your friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do they work? Suppose we want to find out how many kiloseconds there are in one microsecond. Our process is the following. Write our given amount and unit in the numerator and 1 in the denominator. When converting between two units that both have metric prefixes, convert to the base unit first. Next, add another \"track\" which takes us from the base unit to the final unit. Multiply all of the numerators together and write the result (including unit), then repeat for the denominators. Evaluate your new fraction and write the final result, including unit. Thus, the result would look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "![Unit conversion between microseconds to kiloseconds](../img/INT_AY20_MP1_L01_Fig01-Unit_conversion_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As emphasized above, in each of the conversions, the prefix is *replaced* by the power of ten: 1 microsecond is the same as $10^{-6}$ seconds, 1 kilosecond is the same as $10^3$ seconds. In other words, where the prefix is on one side is replaced by the number on the other. Also, note the \"one with the prefix\" is not always on the top or the bottom, it is where it needs to be to cancel out other units, or to give the desired unit at the end. The second part has microseconds in the bottom, to cancel the first one in the top; the third part has kiloseconds in the top, since that is what we want at the end!\n",

    "Is there a more efficient way of writing the carrier's mass than 87,996,900,000 grams?

You can also think of this as moving the decimal point. Every time you move the point to the left, you gain a power of ten, and to the right, you lose one.

However, there is an alternative format, known as **engineering notation**, that is useful for converting from numbers with base SI units into units with prefixes. The idea is to write the number as you would with ordinary scientific notation, but use only a multiple of three as the exponent for the power of ten. Thus, the number out front has to be something between 1 and 1000. For example, if I take the carrier's mass, then\n",

It's pretty close to $9 \\times 10^{10}$ grams, so can't I use that? Well, what it means is that the US Navy has a very precise measurement of the mass of the carrier. This is reflected in the number of **significant figures** reported in their data. Physically, significant figures (or \"sig figs\") depend on how precisely you can measure a quantity. How many sig figs should you use for each of the rulers shown in the figure?\n",

The one on the right has more markings, and therefore you can measure to two digits (\"1.1\" or \"1.2\"). Thus, the left ruler can give 1 sig fig, while the right ruler can give two. A greater number of significant figures means the number has been measured to a higher precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb to use to find the number of sig figs a number has is to think about whether the number had to be written, or whether it is acting as a \"placeholder\" such as zero often does. To spell this out, here are some guidelines:\n",

    "* All non-zero digits are significant: 3.1415 has 5 sig figs, while 3.1 has only 2.\n",

    "The latter two points are why (proper) scientific notation is a good way of writing numbers, to be sure of the number of significant figures. I can write $5.9010 \\times 10^5$, and know the number has 5 sig figs -- I didn't have to write the last zero, so its inclusion means it is significant.\n",
