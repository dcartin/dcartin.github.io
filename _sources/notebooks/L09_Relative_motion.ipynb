    "You probably have a good sense of what relative motion is already. For example, if you are driving down the road in a car, everything going on inside the car will usually appear to be at rest. This is because everything in the car has the same velocity that you do, so your \"relative\" velocities are zero. On the other hand, you will see the cars going in the opposite direction at a really high speed. It is not that they are actually moving this fast (at least according to a bystander on the ground!), but the cars' velocities combine together to produce the high velocity you see. Relative motion deals with how moving objects appear to each other. Vectors will be important here, since the direction of the objects' velocities can change the resulting relative motion. In fact, such ideas are used in ship navigation, where a maneuvering board (or \"moboard\") provides a convenient way of doing relative motion vector calculations. Although they are slower than electronic means, it is always [a good idea](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/april/moboards-will-never-be-obsolete) to know what your equipment is doing, so you can evaluate it properly.\n",

Don't do this! The hard part of relative motion is finding the vectors for each of the object velocities; once you have done this, the relative motion equations do all of the work for me -- don't overthink them!\n",

    "### Creating the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get a better feeling of relative motion, we will go through some examples in vPython. There will be different perspectives on the same motion; changing which viewpoint you see the motion from will change how it appears. The first case you will look at is two objects moving along the $x$ axis. There will be objects R (red sphere) and B (blue sphere), both in motion on top of a green box, the ground (G).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin} Autoscaling\n",
    "The command `canvas(autoscale = False)` is there to avoid the perspective shown from moving, when the objects move in the simulation. By default, vPython automatically scales the scene to keep things in the picture; this command stops that scaling feature.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code in the program below should be familiar to you, but it is worthwhile to go through the parts before we get to what is different than previous cases. It is probably helpful before you run the program below to look through the code as you read through the description given next.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, the code starts with defining time related variables `MAX_TIME`, `t` and `DT`. After that, there are three objects created: two spheres, a red sphere `objR` (object R) and a blue sphere `objB` (object B). Both of these spheres are on top of a third object, a green box `ground`(object G). The only extra piece here is that the objects R and B create a *trail*, which means there is a line indicating the path of each object. You will see that these trails look different, depending on which object's perspective we are using. At the start, it will be how all objects move as seen by the ground. At the end of the code, there is the usual `while` to update the positions of R, B and G.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is new about the code are the velocities. It is important to realize that there are *two* velocities that are important for each object. The first velocities defined are the velocities `velRG`, `velBG` and `velGG`. These are the velocities of the objects as seen by the ground G -- in other words, the vectors ${\\vec v}_{RG}, {\\vec v}_{BG}$ and ${\\vec v}_{GG}$. Since the ground is not moving relative to itself, obviously ${\\vec v}_{GG} = 0$!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of velocities `objR.velocity`, `objB.velocity` and `ground.velocity` tell the computer what motion to show when the program is run. This is *not* necessarily the same as the velocities of the objects as seen by the ground, since we can take the perspective of a different object, as we will do later.\n",

    "As the 1D case, it is probably helpful to read through the explanation of the code given next before you run the program below, since there are a few added parts. The first is that three objects -- `shoreNorth`, `shoreSouth` and `river` -- are created, and then combined using the `compound` module into a single object `ground`. From this point on, this will be the reference frame `ground` (G) used in the code, i.e. not the individual objects. After this, a `vehicle` object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next new part is dealing with the velocity of the AAV. First, a velocity vector `velV` is defined. This is the velocity of the vehicle on *whatever* surface it is on at the moment. If the AAV is driving on the ground, then its velocity ${\\vec v}_{VG}$ is given by `velV`. On the other hand, if the AAV is on water, then `velV` is now the velocity ${\\vec v}_{VW}$ of the AAV on the *water*, not the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the ground is shown as stationary in the animation, so the velocity ${\\vec v}_{VG}$ of the vehicle as seen by the ground must be determined for all cases. The code needs to check whether the AAV is on the water or on the ground in order to give it the correct velocity. If the AAV is on the ground, then it simply moves with its velocity ${\\vec v}_{VG}$ (which is `velV`) from the ground's viewpoint. However, when the vehicle is on the water, we know both ${\\vec v}_{VW}$ and ${\\vec v}_{WG}$, and so the velocity of the AAV in the ground's viewpoint is given by\n",

We have seen here the defining vector equations used to study relative motion, and shown how these work in both one- and two-dimensional motion. This includes programming such motion into vPython, and viewing a scene from the standpoint of various moving objects. Relative motion also allows us to generalize the notion of collisions in the center of mass reference frame to any general situation, with an arbitrary value of the system's momentum.\n",
