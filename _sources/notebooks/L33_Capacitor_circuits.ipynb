    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce the capacitor, another circuit element. Capacitors allow one to store electric charge for later use in applications. In fact, this was the first such device to be specifically discovered and studied for its electrical properties. Up to the mid-18th century, the only source of electric charge was by using a source of static electricity, such as that accumulated by a rotating glass globe, with a woolen cloth rubbed against it as it turned (known as an electrostatic generator). However, this charge could not be stored, but immediately flowed through any objects connected to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor](../img/320px-Andreas_Cunaeus_discovering_the_Leyden_jar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1740's, a few scientists had developed a mechanism for storing static electricity for long periods of time. Since the most famous of these was developed in Leyden, in the Netherlands, it became known as the *Leyden jar*. A jar filled with water had a metal wire draped inside, and electric current from an electrostatic generator was used to charge it up. The caption going along with the artist's rendition above says it all:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 1746, Andreas Cunaeus, an assistant in the laboratory of Pieter von Muschenbroek in Leyden, attempts to \"condense\" electricity in a glass of water. The rotating glass sphere (right) is an electrostatic machine. The static electricity generated by the hands rubbing on it is transferred through the chain to the suspended metal bar, and from it via the hanging wire into the glass of water. The glass acted as a capacitor, and a large charge built up in the water, and an equal charge of the opposite polarity built up in Cunaeus' hand holding the glass. When Cunaeus reached up to pull the wire out of the water, he got a severe shock, much worse than an electrostatic machine could give, because the amount of charge stored was much larger than the terminal of an electrostatic machine could store. Cunaeus took two days to recover. Musschenbroek was also impressed by the powerful shock he received from the device, writing, \"I would not take a second shock for the crown of France\". Reports of the experiment were widely circulated, and scientists began to investigate the charge storage ability of these \"Leyden flasks\". Eventually the water was replaced by foil coatings on the inside and outside of the jar to store the charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the basic idea of a Leyden jar or condenser (what we now call a capacitor) is now used for a variety of purposes in energy storage and electric circuits, and can be found in many electronic devices. This is why electronic equipment has a warning not to remove or try to repair the equipment unless you are a trained electrician, even if the electronic device is no longer plugged it -- there are usually many capacitors in the device, still storing sizeable charges. If you accidentally touched one, you would get the same kind og shock as poor Cunaeus did!\n",

    "## Capacitors\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, the primary function of a **capacitor** is as a device that stores electric charge. A simple capacitor design is to have two metal plates which have no electric contact between them, but have contacts allowing it to be wired to other electric devices. Because of this, the symbol for a capacitor is made of two *equal* lines -- don't confuse this with the unequal lines of a battery symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Symbol for a capacitor](../img/INT_AY21_L33_Fig05_Capacitor_symbol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If connected to a battery, the battery will move electric charge from one plate onto the other. This means that each plate now has a finite amount of charge on it. If the battery is removed, this charge will be stored on the capacitor. Reconnecting the contacts together into a circuit allows the capacitor to drain its charge quickly. Thus, you can think of a capacitor much like the water reservoir behind a dam, or the water stored in a water tower. This water is stored for later use, and can be released by opening a valve.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The real charge on a capacitor:** If you think about the process outlined before, you will note that the *total* charge on the capacitor always stays zero! Whenever we refer to the charge $Q$, we are talking about the charge on a single plate. This is usually given as just a magnitude, since one plate will have charge $+Q$, the other $-Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the resistance was defined in terms of how much current passes through a resistor, given a certain voltage across the element. The **capacitance** of a capacitor is defined in a similar manner. Now, however, it relates how much charge is stored on each plate, given a voltage difference across the plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantity:** capacitance\n",
    "* **Symbol:** $C$\n",
    "* **Units:** farads (F) = coulombs/volt\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    C = \\frac{Q}{V}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Q$ is the amount of charge on *one* plate of the capacitor, and $V$ is the voltage difference between the two plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be a little confused at this point, asking yourself what is the difference between a battery and a capacitor. After all, both store and release charge. However, a battery will release this charge over a very long period of time (hours or days). A capacitor is built to release the charge very quickly -- we will talk about this below, when we discuss RC circuits. This is why capacitors are used in applications such as defibrillators and camera flashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing charge on a capacitor requires energy, so it is natural to ask how much electrical energy is kept in the capacitor as well. Remember that electric potential energy $U_{elec}$ is related to voltage $V$ by $\\Delta U = q \\Delta V$. Now, imagine the electrons placed on the capacitor, one at a time. The very first electron requires basically no energy, since the voltage is essentially zero (from $V = Q/C$ above). Adding every next electron needs a little more energy, though, since the voltage increases with the charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in graph terms, suppose we graph the charge on the capacitor as a function of the voltage across it. This gives the figure below.\n",

    "The slope of the graph is constant, since it is just the capacitance $C$. The area of each of the rectangles is equal to $q \\Delta V$, i.e. the amount of each necessary to put an additional anount of charge on the capacitor plates. These rectangles obviously get larger, as more energy is required to place more charge, when there is already a lot of charge present on the plates. Thus, if we take the limit $\\Delta V \\to 0$, we can see that the total area under the curve is equal to the energy $U$ needed to charge the capacitor up to a given charge $Q = CV$ by a voltage $V$. Since this is just a triangle, then this gives\n",

    "### Equivalent capacitance\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the material here is similar to what we did with resistor circuits, so I will not spend as much verbiage explaining ideas we have seen before. As before, you will need to group capacitors together into series or parallel groups, then continue the process until you have a single equivalent capacitor and a battery. Once this is done, you can use the definition of capacitance to calculate all properies of this equivalent capacitor, then \"unpack\" your series and parallel groupings to do the same for the other physical capacitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be two differences with what we have done before, though. The first is in what kind of table you will use to record your calculations. Obviously, resistance is now replaced with capacitance. In addition, charge on the capacitor is used instead of current through the resistor, and energy stored versus power emitted. This leads to the use of a **QVCU table**, for charge, voltage, capacitance, and energy stored. I will work through an example of this later in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is that the series and parallel equivalent capacitances are \"backwards\" from their equivalent resistance counterparts. In other words, the series equivalent capacitance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal, much like the parallel equivalent resistance. Similarly, the parallel equivalent capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances, as was the series equivalent resistance. The reason for this is the following. If we compare Ohm's law with the definition of capacitance,\n",

    "    C = \\frac{Q}{V}\n",

    "\n",
    "notice that the position of voltage in the capacitance equation is \"flipped\" from the resistance -- i.e. now in the denominator, rather than the numerator. The position of the \"charge\" quantity ($I$ or $Q$) is also reversed. This is the reason why the equivalent capacitances are calculated differently than the equivalent resistances.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will actually work through the parallel case first, since as we will see, it is more straightforward. Suppose we take a group of uncharged capacitors, and arrange them in parallel. We want to calculate what single equivalent capacitor we could replace this group with, and have the same electrical properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Replacing a group of parallel capacitors with an equivalent capacitor](../img/INT_AY21_L33_Fig01_Parallel_capacitors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the loop rule, as we did with resistors, the voltage across any two of these parallel capacitors must be the same. Thus, $V_1 = V_2 = \\cdots = V$. By conservation of charge, the charges on the individual capacitors adds up to the total. If this were otherwise, then the equivalent capacitor would have a different charge than the group, giving it different electrical properties. Thus, $Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + \\cdots$. Putting these together,\n",

    "Using the junction rule, the capacitors all have the same current, since there are no junctions in a series group. I have put the current arrows in a different place here than I did with the resistors, to emphasize the point that the currents are what *change* the charge on each of the capacitors. If these capacitors are initially uncharged, for example, then the currents provide the charge on the capacitor plates. Now, since the capacitors are in series, then the charge on the left plate of $C_2$ is coming from the right plate of $C_1$, and so on down the line. Because the capacitors start with the same charge, the fact that they are in series means they will continue to have the same charge as well, although this charge is now larger than before. This gives $Q = Q_1 = Q_2 = \\cdots$.\n",

In particular, we couldn't say that, because the currents are the same, then all of the charge from one plate is due to being pulled off the plate from an adjacent capacitor. We would have to think about conserving the total charge and energy of the system. This is why I will usually assume the capacitors are initially uncharged, unless I say so explicitly.\n",

    "## Discharging RC circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "The next natural question is to ask what happens when you put resistors and capacitors into the same circuit; these types of circuits are known as **RC circuits**. This may seem a little contrived to you. But remember that every real wire or other electrical connection will always have at least some resistance. So, if even there is not \"officially\" a resistor in a circuit with a capacitor, anything with a capacitor in it will actually be affected by the resistance of the circuit connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are good reasons to create RC circuits for applications. We will see that, by picking the right resistance and capacitance, the RC circuit will have a natural length of time for doing what it does. Thus, RC circuits are often used when a particular timing is desired. Some examples are intermittent windshield wipers and artificial pacemakers used in human hearts. Resistors and capacitors can also be used in combination to reduce the noise in an electrical system; these are known as \"high-pass\" and \"low-pass\" filters, depending on whether they only keep high frequency or low frequency noise, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this lesson, we will use Kirchhoff's laws to analyze circuits with a resistor and a capacitor. The properties of these circuits depend on whether there is a battery present; if there is, then it will act to charge the capacitor. The first case I examine, then, is when there is *no* battery, but the capacitor starts with an initial charge. Later on, I will look at the case when the capacitor is initially uncharged, but a battery is present in the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the loop rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following circuit, with a capacitor $C$ with an initial charge $Q_0$, and a resistor $R$. This will form a **discharging RC circuit**. The only way a capacitor can discharge is if there is no battery putting charge on it! The capacitor acts as the source of current, with the flow of charge caused by the energy stored in the capacitor. As the capacitor discharges, it has less charge and less energy, until it is essentially discharged.\n",

    "The current is assumed to flow in the clockwise direction. This is equivalent to saying that it is the \"bottom\" plate of the capacitor that is the positive plate. Since (conventional) current is the flow of positive charge, a discharging capacitor will lose charge off its positive plate by current flowing away from it, and going onto the negative (top) plate. If this is a bit confusing, just remember we can get the same thing by thinking in terms of electron flow: electrons will leave the negative plate, flow in a counterclockwise direction around the circuit, and deposit onto the positive charge, reducing its total charge. Electron flow is always in the opposite direction to conventional current, so it all works out.\n",
