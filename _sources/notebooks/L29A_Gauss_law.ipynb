    "# Gauss' law\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we looked at the idea of electric field lines. When Michael Faraday first developed the idea that eventually became the electric field, he had in mind physical \"lines of force\" that start and stop at electric charges. Specifically, he thought of a tube beginning at a positive charge, and ending at a negative charge. Although James Clerk Maxwell, and his successors, later formalized this into a more abstract idea, the idea of field lines is a helpful one for various physical situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss' law is one important example of the utility of thinking in this way. Remember that field lines point away from a positive charge. So, suppose we put this positive charge in a *closed* box (so that all field lines leaving the charge also go through the box), then all of the field lines that penetrate the surface of the box are pointing outward, away from the box's interior. If we say every electric field line going through the box is positive if it leaves the box, then the net sum of all of the field lines is positive. Similarly, if we replace the positive charge with a negative one, the sum is now negative, since all of the field lines are going into the box and the negative charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, thinking in terms of field lines gives us an intuition that there is a relationship between the amount of charge inside of a closed surface, and the amount of electric field going through the same surface. This is the content of Gauss' law. This relation can be very powerful, allowing us to rather simply find the electric field magnitude around certain distributions of charge. In this lesson, we will make this process more formal, and show some examples of how to use it in practice. We will also build up these charge distributions in vPython simulations, so that we can see directly that Coulomb's law -- added up for many charges -- indeed gives Gauss' law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the concept of a gaussian surface.\n",
    "* State Gauss' law for electrostatics.\n",
    "* Calculate the magnitude of the electric field for a symmetric charge distribution."

    "## Electric properties of materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the mathematics of Gauss' law, it is first necessary to talk about the electrical properties of materials. In particular, we will divide substances into two broad categories: conductors and insulators. Although this is a rather broad (and inaccurate) brush, for conductors, at least, we are on fairly safe ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic dividing line between the two categories is how easy it is for electric charge to move inside the material. You can think it terms of attaching a particular object to a battery -- if you try to send excess electrons through the object, will current actually flow? If the material is a conductor, then the answer is yes! A **conductor** is a substance where charges will freely move (or \"conduct\") through the substance without hindrance. Most metals are conductors, which is why they are the material of choice for making electric wires. On the flip side are **insulators**, substances where electric charge is not free to move at all. These materials are used to insulate electric wires, so you don't get shocked when you touch them! Examples include glass and rubber.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is this division useful for Gauss' law? The key fact we will use quite a bit is what happens when an *external* electric field passes through a conductor. Imagine we place a piece of copper inside of a mechanism that creates electric fields. Because the charges are free to move inside the conducting copper, the electric field will create forces on these charges. Therefore, they will start moving around. However, eventually they will arrange themselves into positions where the net force on each charge is zero. This means that the charges inside the copper have moved to create their own, *internal*, electric field that cancels out the external field! This process is shown in the picture below, where the red positive charges and green negative charges will separate to create the internal field.\n",
    "\n",
    "![External fields through conductors cause internal charges to rearrange themselves until the external field is cancelled out](../img/INT_AY20_MP3_L06_Fig03-Fields-inside-conductors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this internal electric field cancels out the external one -- the charges are now at an equilibrium position -- this means that the net electric field inside a conductor is zero. This is the key physical fact that we will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The electric field inside of an ideal conductor is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This zero internal electric field is caused by charge moving to the surface of the conductor. Note that if the conductor has an *excess* charge, that charge will create its own (external) field! To see this, note that the charges in the picture above arranged themselves on the conductor's surface in order to cancel out the external field. However, on the outside of the conductor the electric field lines still leave these surface charges."

    "\n",
    "### Counting field lines through a surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start developing the intuitive picture given above in the overview. Remember that, in a rough sense, we saw that the number of electric field lines going through a closed surface is related to the charge enclosed inside that surface. To make this sharper, we need to define some vectors related to an arbitrary surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a (flat) surface in a plane with some area $A$. Imagine a square tile on a bathroom floor, or a mat in front of a door. The **normal vector** ${\\hat n}$ to this surface is a vector that points perpendicular to the plane of the surface. Note that we are using the word \"normal\" here in the same sense we did when we talked about the normal force. Something is normal if it is perpendicular to something else -- just as the normal force is perpendicular to a surface, the normal vector is also perpendicular to the area in question. This vector ${\\hat n}$ will point towards the \"outside\" when we have a closed surface; it will help us determine the direction of the electric field lines through the surface. Finally, the **area vector** ${\\vec A}$ of the surface is a vector ${\\vec A}$ with a magnitude equal to the area of the surface, and whose direction is given by the normal vector ${\\hat n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The normal and area vectors for a square in the $x-y$ plane](../img/INT_AY20_MP3_L06_Fig01-Area-normal-vecs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now define \"electric flux\" $\\Phi_E$ as a way to quantify how many electric field lines pass through an area. If you think about what this means, we want to see how much of the electric field vector is perpendicular to the surface the field passes through. Thus, the angle between the electric field and the surface will matter. This is why I defined the area vector above! If the electric field is parallel to the *area vector*, then the field is perpendicular to the *surface*, and thus \"through\" the surface. However, if the electric field is perpendicular to the area vector, then the field does not go through the surface, but is instead \"along\" the surface. This generates zero electric flux through the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we wanted to find how much of one vector was in the same direction as the other, we used the scalar product (Lesson 11) to find it. In other words, the scalar product of two vectors is larger when the angle between the vectors gets smaller. This is because, for two vectors ${\\vec C}$ and ${\\vec D}$, the scalar product is given by their magnitudes $C, D$, and the angle $\\theta_{CD}$ between the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec C} \\cdot {\\vec D} = CD \\cos \\theta_{CD}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can define the **electric flux** through an surface of area $A$ as the scalar product of the electric field ${\\vec E}$ and the area vector ${\\vec A}$ of the surface. Intuitively, we can say that there are \"more field lines\" passing through the surface when (1) there is a larger electric field or (2) a larger area, and (3) these two are aligned so the field lines pass through the surface.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see this in the figure below, which shows the extreme cases. On the left, the electric field lines pass directly through the blue surface. This means that the electric field is pointing in the same direction as the area vector, so there is zero angle between them, maximizing the flux. On the right, the electric field points along the surface, so none of the field lines actually go through the surface. Thus, the electric fiel ${\\vec E}$ is perpendicular to the area vector ${\\vec A}$, and the scalar product is zero -- there is no electric flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Maximum and mininum electric flux through a surface $A$](../img/INT_AY20_MP3_L06_Fig02-Max-min-flux.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> {\\bf Watch your angles!} One confusing point when finding the electric flux is how the direction of the electric field is given. For example, suppose the field is perpendicular to the surface. You might think this means the angle between ${\\vec E}$ and ${\\vec A}$ is then zero, but it's not! That's because the vector ${\\vec A}$ is *also* perpendicular to the surface (because it is built from the normal vector). So if the field is perpendicular to the surface, that gives the maximum flux, since the field and area vectors point in the same direction. Be careful when you use your angles!"

    "\n",
    "First, given a charge distribution, we find a gaussian surface that matches the symmetry of the problem; this makes the calculations much easier. What do I mean by \"match the symmetry\"? Well, think about a point charge sitting at the origin. If I revolve around the charge -- meaning, if I move to another position, just with the same distance away from the charge -- then the situation looks exactly the same. This means I should get the same answer for the electric field at this new position. What is a shape that looks the same if I move to any new position with the same radius? A sphere! Thus, a spherical gaussian surface matches the symmetry of a single point charge, in that the physics of the problem looks exactly the same when you are at the same radius from the charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to think about how to find the electric flux. We will do this by taking the total area $A_{sph}$ of the sphere, and dividing it into little flat bits $\\Delta A_i$; we are indexing each piece by a label $i$. Obviously, a sphere is not flat, so eventually we want to mathematically take the pieces of area to be as small as possible. In other words, we will take the limit $\\Delta A_i \\to 0$. For now, though, we are not going to worry about it. Since we chose flat pieces, then we can easily say what the direction of the normal vector ${\\hat n}$ is for each piece (choosing the direction *away* from the center of the sphere). This means each flat bit has an area vector ${\\vec A}_i = (\\Delta A_i) {\\hat n}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gauss' law is a powerful technique to find the electric field for a symmetric charge distribution. Whenever the physical situation looks the same when you rotate your perspective, or move along a line, then you can set up a gaussian surface that matches the symmetry. From this surface, you can choose the field that goes along with this symmetry, and rather easily solve for the magnitude of the field. Most of the hard mathematical work is done for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we do not discuss it here, there is a version of Gauss' law for any force that obeys an inverse square law. This means there is a gravitational version of Gauss' law, with similar properties to what we saw here: the number of gravitational field lines through a closed surface is proportional to the mass enclosed by the surface. The constant of proportionality will depend on $G$ here, rather than $k$. Unlike the electrostatic force, however, there is no gravitational version of a \"conductor\". This means that there is a gravitational field everywhere in the Universe, regardless of the location of any masses. By the way, this is the reason that [gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.org/) are such a powerful new technique in astronomy -- they pass through everything! Different kinds of electromagnetic waves (light) can be stopped by various kinds of matter, but a gravitational wave will go right through.\n",
