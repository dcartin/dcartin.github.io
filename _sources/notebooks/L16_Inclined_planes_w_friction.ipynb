    "In this lesson, we are going to combine what we have done over the previous two lessons, i.e. add friction to an object on an inclined plane or ramp. Because friction is involved, this means our first step is usually going to be solving for the normal force acting on the object. Then we use this to find the force of friction. Thus, it will be important to completely solve the Newton's second law equations for the object on the ramp -- meaning in both the parallel and perpendicular directions.\n",

    "Suppose that a child slides down a playground slide with an acceleration magnitude of 1.26 m/s$^2$. Assuming the slide is at a constant 33.0$^\\circ$ angle to the horizontal, what is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the slide and the child? As always, we first set up the FBD for the situation. The relevant forces here are the gravitational, friction, and normal forces. Since the acceleration is along the ramp, it makes sense to use unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the ramp. The frictional force opposes the motion down the slide, so it points up the slide. Thus, the FBD looks like the diagram shown below.\n",

If you watch the video linked below, you will see sand poured onto an existing sand pile. The angle of the pile with respect to the horizontal will never get to be more than about 35 degrees or so. If this does happen, the sand at the top will slide down, until the angle is again below the angle of repose.

This should give you some practice in applying Newton's second law to a situation with multiple forces acting on an object. In particular, with an applied force included, this force can have components both parallel and perpendicular to the ramp. If the applied force has a perpendicular part, the normal force can change, thus altering the frictional force parallel to the ramp. Therefore, this is a situation where what is happening in one direction can affect the motion in a perpendicular direction. This will be the generic situation for force problems.\n",
