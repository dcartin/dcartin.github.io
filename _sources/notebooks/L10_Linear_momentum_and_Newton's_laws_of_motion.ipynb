    "# Linear momentum and Newton's laws of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's laws of motion form a crucial piece of physics, both historically and conceptually. We will be building a lot of what we do in this course on them, so it is important to make sure you understand these concepts! They deal with the relationship between \"forces\" and the acceleration of an object. Up to this point, the acceleration vector has been handed to you, and you can then use the kinematic equations to solve for the position and velocity of the object at any time. In vPython, we did the same thing, using updating methods based on average velocity and acceleration. But in all of these cases, the reason for a particular acceleration was perhaps mysterious. Newton's laws of motion will allow us to calculate the acceleration of an object explicitly, based on its physical situation, and thus the forces acting on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will explore the laws of motion and their consequences, without worrying about specific forces. We will focus here on the observable consequences of Newton's laws. For example, how can I see the effect of a force on a moving object? How do interactions between objects work? To do this, we will define the concept of \"momentum\", which directly relates to the motion of an object; from there, forces will intuitively be things that change momentum. Starting with [Lesson 12 (Solving force problems)](force-prob), we will begin to bring in specific forces -- such as gravity, tension, friction, and the normal force -- and look at how they affect the motion of objects.\n",

    "In the 17th century, there was much controversy among physicists -- there was a general sense of a quantity conserved during motion (generically called \"force\"), but a lack of understanding of what it was. For example, Descartes argued for the quantity $m|{\\vec v}|$; notice this is a scalar quantity! On the other hand, Leibniz argued for $mv^2$. The first evolved into linear momentum; the latter we will see later in [Lesson 19](work-KE) is twice the kinetic energy of an object.\n",

He attended Cambridge University; while it was closed from 1665 to 1667 due to the Great Plague (social distancing!), he started developing his laws of motion, principles of optics, and a universal law of gravitation. In later years, he acted as Master of the Mint, taking responsibility for the coinage in England, and wrote many works dealing with interpretations of the Bible.\n",

    "### Definition of linear momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see when we get into the actual laws of motion, objects have \"inertia\". Inertia literally translates as \"laziness\", and is the physical property of objects to continue their state of motion unless an interaction with other objects causes a change in this motion. This is a bit of a vague statement, so \"linear momentum\" is used to quantify this property. This is a quantity that is the simplest way to combine two facts: the objects we deal with have a mass, and these objects will continue with a constant velocity until outside forces combine to change this velocity. Thus, *linear momentum* ${\\vec p}$ is defined as a *vector* with the same direction as velocity.\n",

    "* **SI units:** kg $\\cdot$ m/s\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can say that inertia corresponds to a constant linear momentum, and forces due to an interaction will change this momentum. Note that we tack on the adjective \"linear\" because we are dealing right now with things moving along a line. Later when we consider rotation, there will be a \"angular\" or \"rotational\" version of momentum, relating to the property of continuing rotational motion.\n",

    "We all have an inituitive idea of what a force is, based on our experiences in the natural world, although sometimes the effects of forces are confused with the \"natural motion\" of an object. For example, when we slide a book across a table, we expect that it will slow to a stop, so we may push it harder to get it to the opposite side of the table. Thinking in physics terms, though, it is not that books \"want\" to come to rest, but that there is a frictional force acting on the book preventing it from remaining at constant velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, let's talk about the common properties of forces. Usually, forces are a *push or a pull* that can cause objects to change velocity (or accelerate). This can result in either a change in speed or direction, or both. Here are some common forces. One is the force $F_g$ due to gravity, also know as the object's **weight**.

Now, when we talk about Newton's universal law of gravitation, we will see that the net (gravitational) force on one object due to the others around it is found by adding all of the forces due to each of the other objects. This is known as the **principle of superposition**. In particular, there is a gravitational interaction between masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, which gives rise to a force $F_{g, 12}$ on mass $m_1$, and a force $F_{g, 21}$ on mass $m_2$. Notice how the subscripts change!. $F_{ij}$ is the force on object $i$ to due its interaction with object $j$.\n",

I do *not* care about how the other masses are affecting each other -- I don't need to know what the force is between masses $m_2$ and $m_3$, for example. All I would need to calculate are the three forces due to $m_1$ interacting with $m_2, m_3$, and $m_4$.

There are three possible forces acting on the objects: a force between $A$ and $B$ (${\\vec F}_{AB} = -{\\vec F}_{BA}$), a force between $A$ and the outside (${\\vec F}_{A, out}$), and a force between $B$ and the outside (${\\vec F}_{B, out}$).

The sled pulls on the truck with a force of 250 N to the left. The force of friction between the road and the truck's tires is 1000 N.\n",

For the truck, there are two external forces: the force on the truck, from the road (i.e. friction), and the force on the truck due to the sled. If I look at the combined system, the only external force is the force on the truck due to the road. In this last case, the internal forces are those between the truck and the sled.

The diagram below considers the three possible systems we can make out of the truck and sled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the diagram above, I have also drawn diagrams to indicate the forces acting on each system. This type of diagram is known as a *free body diagram* (or FBD), and is a compact and effective way of showing all the forces.

Using Newton's 2nd law for this, we get an acceleration of 0.500 m/s$^2$ to the right. Note this is the acceleration of *both* truck and sled, since they are attached -- they move together as one unit.\n",

We know the mass of the sled, its acceleration, and the net force is simply the force on the sled due to the truck. Putting all of this together gives this force is 250. N to the right.

Remember that Newton's 3rd law says that forces represent an interaction between two objects, so what you know may guide you in choosing one of the affected objects over the other.
