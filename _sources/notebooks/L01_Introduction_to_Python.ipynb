    "In this lesson, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language. You will use this in subsequent lessons to explore some of the foundations of physics; I hope you have fun creating these simulations on your computer! Python was invented in 1990 by Guido van Rossem, a Dutch computer scientist. Python is a modern, object-oriented language which is easy to learn. All of the instructions you give the computer will be in the Python programming language. These instructions are collectively called **code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physics uses tools from many other different areas -- writing, mathematics, and more recently, computer programming. Nowadays, any working scientist, mathematician, or engineer should know at least the basics of writing a computer program.\n",
    "* In Python, we can create simulations that illustrate what is happening in physical situations. This helps to understand aspects of physics that are difficult to see using other methods.\n",
    "* Both physics and computer programming involve thinking logically about a problem, and solving it in a methodical way. In particular, you must understand the physics concepts yourself before you can explain it clearly and precisely to a computer!\n",
    "* An important skill in programming is learning how to *debug* a program -- figuring out where in the program code a mistake has been made, and fixing it. Sometimes this can take a while! A similar skill is very useful in finding the error in a physics problem solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is very common language that is relatively easy to learn, but has lots of add-ons for powerful applications.\n",
    "* There are several physics classes across the country that use Python programs in their class.\n",
    "* We will often use the vPython package, which allows us to easily create 3D visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson goes through some of the basic concepts and Python commands we will need to study the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Trying the code\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "The *only* way to learn anything in life is to try it yourself. Watching another person do something does not teach you anything; you have to do it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, these lessons are written specifically so that you can work through them interactively when you are using the online version at [https://dcartin.github.io/](https://dcartin.github.io/). As you look through the pages of the online book, you will see programming code embedded on the site, using a website called Trinket ([https://trinket.io/](https://Trinket.io/)). When you get to these programs, it is strongly recommended you not only run them, but also modify them to see how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, you will complete programming assingments based on what is covered in this lesson and the following one ([Lesson 02](vec-vPy)). To do this, you should create an account (for free) on [Glowscript.org](https://www.glowscript.org/). You may want to use your personal email account, so you can modify these programs after you leave NAPS.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read through this lesson, you should keep in mind the specific objectives I hope you achieve. Every lesson will have such a list, and these lists also appear in the course syllabus. You should read through the objectives carefully first thing -- don't skip it! Below is your checklist for this lesson, the things you should get out of your reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Print the value of a numerical variable or a string to the screen using the `print` statement.\n",
    "* Create a Python program.\n",
    "* Define a variable, and state the rules for Python variable names.\n",
    "* Add a comment to a program.\n",
    "* Update the value of a numerical variable.\n",
    "* Use the mathematical operators `+, -, *, /, %` to calculate the new value of a variable.\n",
    "* Use an `if` statement to check whether a logical condition is true.\n",
    "* Use a `while` loop to implement statements until a logical condition is false.\n",
    "* Create a list of values.\n",
    "* Select a specific value from an existing list.\n",
    "* Create a function with specified arguments that returns a desired quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot here, but most are relatively short. This lesson is also an important foundation for *all* of the Python we will use in the course, so I put it all in one lesson! If you don't feel you can do these things, you should work at it -- did you miss an important definition? Try the problems? Maybe playing around with the code examples more, and thinking of different scenarios will help. Remember, the online version of this textbook at [https://dcartin.github.io/](https://dcartin.github.io/) has interactive versions of these programs."

    "Let's walk through this code, to make sure you understand what it does. First, we define `NUMBER` to be the number we are finding the multiples of, then `total` will be the variable where we store our values as the program runs. We count the number of times we have added a multiple to the sum as the variable `numMultiples`, and set the maximum number of such additions as `MAX_NUM_MULTIPLES`. Inside the `while` loop, we increase the number of multiples by one everytime we add a multiple of `NUMBER` to `total`. When we have gone over the number of multiples we want, we quit the `while` loop, and print out the final answer. Since this sum is $7 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 35$, then the answer is 105.\n",

You could copy the code over and over, but that is a pain. Instead, we create a procedure `firstFiveMultOfSeven()`, which every time we run it, it goes through the same code and prints out the result. This is given by the code below; notice that it is not very different from the program above, except for the first line. The `def` command tells Python to create the procedure with our given name `firstFiveMultOfSeven()`. By the way, I will often put parentheses after the name of a procedure or function when I describe it, so you know it is not a variable.\n",

An **argument** is something I pass to the function or procedure for its use. This can be a variable, a list, or some other possibilities we will not worry about. The arguments are defined outside the function or procedure, which can perform operations on these quantities. Getting back to our procedure, the two arguments of `multipleSum()` are the values `NUMBER` and `MAX_NUM_MULTIPLES`.

Plus this is good practice for applying the methods of this lesson. Finally, there is a way to find the square root, but it is not automatically included in Python. Instead, it is part of the `math` module of Python. I will introduce modules in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy).\n",

    "Now I will go through an example that brings together a lot of what is covered in the lesson. By the end, we will have a function that calculates the square root of a given positive number. The method used here is known as \"Heron's method\", after the 1st century AD Greek mathematician Heron of Alexandria. It is also known as \"the Babylonian method\", since it is believed (but not proven) that the ancient Babylonians were also aware of this method. Although there are now more sophisticated means of finding roots, this will give you some idea of how your calculator gets the number!\n",

    "Here is the basic idea. Suppose we want to know the square root of the number $c$. Thus, we are trying to solve the equation $x^2 - c = 0$. We can make a guess $g$ for what the square root is; for example, we can guess that the square root of two is $g = 1$. Obviously, this is wrong, so there is some error $e$ that our guess is off by. This means that we have $(g + e)^2 = c$. Let's solve this equation for $e$; if we expand it out, we have\n",

    "You can modify the method given above to find the cube root of a number. Suppose we want to find the cube root of $c$, i.e. find the value $x$ such that $x^3 - c = 0$. If we make a guess $x = g$ with an integer $g$, then in general this will be off by some error $e$, such that $(g + e)^3 = c$. Multiplying this out, we have\n",

    "This lesson covers a lot of the Python ideas and commands you will use in other lessons. In particular, it covers variables, mathematical operations, `while` and `if` statements, lists, logical tests, and functions and procedures. It may seem like a lot, but with practice, you will get used to it all. You should review this lesson every once in a while, to make sure you haven't forgotten anything, or if you need a reminder of how a particular command works. Note that this is a rather simplified version of Python -- there are many other commands that we will not use in these lessons. However, it does give you a basic familiarity with the language. If you are interested in learning more, there are *many* resources on-line, since Python is a very popular language. If you sign up for a free Trinket account, you can find some helpful introductions on the Home page of your account, under \"Featured Courses\". Two other sites I find nice are [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and [Easy Python Docs](http://easypythondocs.com/); just realize they feature the *entire* language!\n",

    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create numerical variables, and print the values of these variables\n",
    "* Use mathematical operators to change the value of a variable\n",
    "* Use an `if` statement to make a logical test\n",
    "* Create a `while` or `for` loop\n",
    "* Create a list\n",
    "* Create a procedure or function with arguments"
