    "In physics, one of the most powerful methods used to understand a situation is the use of conservation methods. Remember that these are cases where we can say some physical quantity for a system stays the same, regardless of any kind of interactions between components of the system. Knowing that something remains constant, even when you do not know all the details of what is happening to the system, allows you to find out a lot about the system's evolution. We have seen two conservation laws already -- the conservation of linear momentum (when there is no net external force), and the conservation of angular momentum (no external torque). This lesson and the next are now working towards the third: the conservation of mechanical energy. In particular, here I set the stage for energy by defining *work* and *kinetic energy*; [Lesson 20](energy) will define *potential energy* and *mechanical energy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to take stock of what we have covered to this point in the class as a whole, and what is coming up next. At this point, we have discussed *forces* and *momentum* (both linear and angular). The idea of a force is inituitively obvious -- you probably have a sense of it as a \"push\" or a \"pull\". Newton's second law then built a bridge between forces and momentum, with net forces acting on an object changing the momentum of that object. We wrote down a mathematical definition of momentum, but the tie-in with Newton's laws gives us an notion of momentum as a measure of the object's *inertia*, its tendency to remain at a constant velocity unless acted on by outside forces. Using forces allows us to find the acceleration of an object, and the kinematic equations then give the complete motion of the object over a given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike forces and momentum, the idea of energy is not as intuitive. I can feel the force of the wall as I lean against it; I do not \"see\" the force of gravity, but I *can* see its effect on anything I let go of; friction and air resistance are so familiar that we automatically expect objects to slow down to a stop, and we may quietly think that inertia doesn't quite make sense! However, I can't see how the energy of a dropped object changes as it falls, or that of a car braking to a stop. So what is energy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture I have in my head when I think of energy is that of accounting and money. If there is something I want, there are three ways that I can get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can barter with you, i.e. trade you another physical object that you want.\n",
    "* I can give you something, like gold or silver coins, which everyone has decided is a \"store of value\". In other words, we usually do not need the coins themselves, but they are a *representation* of a certain utility to the person who currently has them.\n",
    "* I can use my credit card to buy the item. When I use the card, my bank will decrease the size of a particular number on its computer, and your bank will increase the size of another number on its computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, energy is this last sense of money -- in physics, we can attach certain numbers to objects, and these numbers change based on the motion of the object. By themselves, these numbers may be abstract, but as we will see, physicists have chosen the numbers well. Increasing or decreasing these numbers will represent physical processes, much like changing the number for my credit card buys my weekly groceries! So yes, energy is not something I can \"put a finger on\", but it is tied to motions that I can observe. We will see that energy methods are very powerful, and are useful in a variety of situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "To get a start into energy methods, it is usual to begin with the notion of *work*. Unfortunately, this is a word that we use in everyday language to mean many things, but in physics, it has a very particular definition, given below, so it is very important to make sure you use the term properly.\n",

    "Work transfers energy either into ($W > 0$) or out of ($W < 0$) a system.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, this may seem a bit circular, since we have not defined \"energy\" yet, but as we will see next, the mathematical definition of work includes forces acting over a distance. For now, think of it using our credit card analogy from above -- work is like using the card to buy something, and changes numbers in our \"energy\" bank accounts that we will define later. Positive work will increase the energy of the system, while negative work will decrease the system's energy.\n",

Now we are looking at the action of a force on an object, as the object moves over a displacement $\\Delta {\\vec r}$. The reason for defining impulse was its application with Newton's second law of motion; by the end of this lesson, you will see how the work defined here ties into a particular form of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get back to our intuition about positive, negative, and zero work? Remember when we talked about the scalar product in [Lesson 09](scal-prod), that for two vectors ${\\vec A}$ and ${\\vec B}$, the scalar ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B} = AB \\cos \\theta$. Here, $A$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of the two vectors, and $\\theta$ is the angle between them. Thus, the sign of ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$ depends only on this angle $\\theta$.

When $\\theta_F < 90.0^\\circ$, then $\\cos \\theta_F > 0$ and the work is positive; the two vectors tend to point in the same direction. On the other hand, when $\\theta_F > 90.0^\\circ$, the vectors ${\\vec F}$ and $\\Delta {\\vec r}$ are pointing in opposite directions, more or less, and the work is negative, since $\\cos \\theta_F < 0$.

Suppose a 32.0 kg crate is pushed across a rough horizontal floor a distance of 10.0 m. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is 0.200. The person pushes on the crate with a force with a magnitude of 90.0 N, at an angle of 22.0$^\\circ$ below the horizontal. The crate accelerates to the right with a value of 46.2 cm/s$^2$.

The code shows the animation of the ball, and also creates a graph of the total work done on `ball` as a function of its vertical position $r_y$. The simulation stops when the ball hits the ground, since the `while` loop only runs when `ball.pos.y > 0`.\n",

Then, inside the `while` loop, update the variable `work` to find the total work done on the ball due to the net force. Use the definition of work given above to find this. Remember that you can use `dot()` in vPython to find the scalar product of two vectors; you can see this in action in [Lesson 09](scal-prod:vPy).

Since the force of gravity only acts downward near the surface of the Earth, any horizontal motion of the object does not change $W_g$.

At this point, you may think I am being very picky over something that doesn't matter. For now, you would be right! However, when there are other changes to the system -- e.g. the object changes size, volume or internal energy (temperature) -- then net work may alter more than just the kinetic energy.

In that lesson, we used the concept of the coefficient of restitution $\\epsilon$ to divide up collisions into elastic and inelastic collisions. Specifically, I defined the coefficient of restitution as the ratio of the final to initial *relative* speeds of two objects. If I call these objects 1 and 2, with initial velocities ${\\vec v}_{1, i}, {\\vec v}_{2, i}$, and final velocities ${\\vec v}_{1, f}, {\\vec v}_{2, f}$, then we have that\n",

    "The advantange of this definition is that the difference between an elastic and an inelastic collision is more visible, particularly in the \"springiness\" of the collision. An elastic collision, with $\\epsilon = 1$, is one where the two objects leave the collision at the same relative speed as they enter it. If you were an ant on one of two colliding hockey pucks, from your vantage point, you would see the second puck enter and leave the collision with the same speed. On the other hand, an inelastic collision, with $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, has the ant see the final relative speed as less than the initial; the pucks do not bounce off of each other with the same \"springiness\" as they came into the collision. When $\\epsilon = 0$, the two objects stick together, so their final relative speed is just zero.\n",

    "Although classifying collisions according to relative speeds is nice, it has the disadvantage that the calculation can be involved, especially when considering collisions in two dimensions. Notice that we are finding the difference in two velocity vectors (before and after the collision), then the magnitude of this difference. Coding this in vPython is not too bad, but doing it by pencil and paper can be lengthy. It would be nice to have another method to divide up collisions.\n",

    "```{margin} The fine print\n",
    "The reason the ratio of the kinetic energies is not the same as the coefficient of restitution is a little subtle. However, it basically boils down to the fact that the sum of the system's kinetic energy really includes *two* contributions. The first is the kinetic energy of the system, taken as a whole, as its moves with its center of mass velocity. This is the part coming from the fact we can consider the system as if it were one object. The second contribution are the individual kinetic energies, coming from the \"internal\" motion of each object, relative to the system as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining the coefficient of restitution as the ratio of relative speeds, the vector difference inside the relative speed calculation nicely gets rid of the center of mass motion. This leaves only the internal motions of each object. Unfortunately, doing the same for kinetic energy would involve some extra effort, so I don't worry about it here.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out there is, in fact, another way to find out if a collision is elastic, using kinetic energy! Unfortunately, this does not map over cleanly to the coefficient of restitution, although that concept is in the background. The idea is to look at the change in the kinetic energy of the system as a whole. I will do this by looking at the final system kinetic energy of the system, as a fraction of the initial system kinetic energy. This can be expressed as the ratio\n",

    "Let's go back to the two-dimensional collision examples in [Lesson 12](CM-coll:2D-coll), to see how this works. For the first problem, I will repeat the problem statement here, but you should go back to the original discussion to remind yourself of how we did it there. The drawing below shows a collision between two pucks on an air-hockey table. Puck A has a mass of 23.0 g and is moving along the $x$ axis with a speed of 5.50 m/s. It makes a collision with puck B, which has a mass of 63.0 g and is initially at rest. The collision is not head-on. After the collision, the two pucks fly apart with the angles shown in the drawing. The final speed of puck A is 3.38 m/s.\n",

    "We have now defined the basics of energy -- work and kinetic energy -- as well as the work-energy theorem that relates the two. As we will see in the next lesson, we will build off of this relation in order to define conservation of mechanical energy. This will be done by focusing on how to find the net work on a system. In particular, we will find that there are special forces, where for each such force, we can define a \"potential energy\". This potential energy, like the kinetic energy, is simply a scalar, whose change tells you something about the evolution of the system in time.\n",
