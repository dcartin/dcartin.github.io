    "What we now call \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" have been familiar to many for over two thousand years. However, for much of that time, they were interesting effects, and not much else; there was no theory behind the existence of electric and magnetic properties. In fact, although some had suspected a relationship between them, nothing definite was known. This began to change in the 18th and 19th centuries, as technology advanced to the point where they could be studied. In particular, with the development of the electric battery by Volta in 1800, a continuous electric current was possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bridge between electricity and magnetism was first built by the efforts of the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Oersted, who did the necessary experiments around 1820. In these, he showed that a constant electric current through a wire produced a magnetic field. Again, it is useful to take a moment and think how important this result was. Although electric and magnetic fields have some similarities (as discussed in [Lesson 34](mag-field)), this does not necessarily mean they are one and the same phenomenon. However, it was the results of Oersted, and many others in the next few years, who conclusively showed that we should not think of \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" separately, but instead to put it into \"electromagnetism\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will not get into this further in this course, the unification of electricity and magnetism was an important event in the history of physics. Over the next 175 years or so, the main course of theoretical physics was a similar path of unification, using many mathematical ideas first developed for electromagnetism. The fruits of this are in what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics, joining electromagnetism together with the strong nuclear force (keeping nuclei together) and the weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactive decay). The Standard Model uses the idea of fields as a basic component, and represents our best current knowledge of how fundamental physics works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will answer a basic question: where do magnetic fields come from? Shortly after Oersted published his experiments, a key part of the answer was found by two physicists, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart, building off the idea of the motion of electric charge in a current giving a magnetic field. We will explore their results in this lesson.\n",

    "## Long, straight wires\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we state the Biot-Savart law, let's first talk about what Oersted found in his experiments. Suppose we have a long, straight wire; basically, we are considering a straight wire whose length is much greater than its radius (or thickness). Oersted sent a current through such a wire, and saw that a nearby compass changed its direction every time he did this. When he turned off the current, the compass returned to its original orientation. Oersted grasped that this was because the current in the wire was creating a magnetic field of its own! After some confusion about the direction of this field, Oersted finally realized that the magnetic field around the wire is circular. In other words, we would say that the magnetic field lines are circles, with their center at the wire itself. You can see a reproduction of Oersted's experiment in the video given below ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3A17._%D0%95%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82.ogv)). When there is no current through the wire, the compass points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. However, when the voltage source is turned on, and current flows through the wire, the compass shifts to point in the direction of the much stronger magnetic field of the wire."

You might be surprised that we are not finding the field at some point near a long, straight wire, but it turns out the circular loop of wire is actually an easier place to start! Imagine we have a circular loop with a radius $R$ and a current $I$ flowing through it. We want to find the total magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at the point $P$, at the center of the circular wire. To do this, we can pretend that the circle is a regular polygon with a large number of sides $N$, and add up the contributions from the current flowing through each of these sides.

Since we are dividing the circle into $N$ parts, each point $P_k$ is an angle $2\\pi k/N$ along the circle from the $+x$ axis.

    "\n",
    "In the last section, we derived the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, by dividing the loop into small pieces $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$, and then adding up the magnetic field contributions $\\Delta {\\vec B}$ from each of these pieces. Now we'll turn to the magnetic field created by a long, straight wire. Here, \"long\" just means that the total length of the wire is large compared to the radius of the circular wire itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for the magnetic field at a point $P$ some distance away from a long, straight wire is more complicated than that for the circular loop, so I will just sketch the method you can use here. Much like the circular loop, you can divide the straight wire into smaller segments $\\Delta \\ell$, and find the magnetic field contribution $\\Delta {\\vec B}$ from each of these segments. The sum of these would then give the total magnetic field. However, unlike the loop, each of these contributions $\\Delta {\\vec B}$ is not the same, for two reasons. First, the distances from the point $P$ to each segment will be different, as you move further away from $P$ along the wire. As you do this, you will also have the fact that the vector product $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell} \\times {\\hat r}$ is different for different segments; basically, the angle between the two vectors changes at different locations along the wire. Taking care of these aspects requires either a somewhat involved vPython program, or else integral calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's do this a much easier way -- we can guess the form of the final ${\\vec B}$ for a long, straight wire, and see why it is true, starting from the Biot-Savart law. This relation tells us that ${\\vec B}$ should be proportional to $\\mu_0$ and $I$. If we look at the units of the rest, ${\\hat r}$ is unitless (remember we divide ${\\vec r}$ by its magnitude). The remaining pieces are $\\Delta \\ell$ and $r^2$, which gives units of 1/length. Since the wire is infinite, the only relevant length is the distance $R$ between the wire and the observation point $P$. Thus, we expect that the magnitude $B$ is given by\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now talked about the sources of magnetic fields, which are all variations on current-carrying wires. Unlike the electric field (where the sources were just charges), the resulting magnetic fields are more complicated. This comes from the three-dimensional nature of the Biot-Savart law, as opposed to the simpler electric field equation due to a point charge. Hopefully you are getting some good practice with the vector product!\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the point, magnetic fields are created by the motion of electric charge: something electric is changing to give something magnetic. This relationship was shown to work both ways, which is why we now think of \"electromagnetism\", rather than \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" separately. This deep marriage of the two will continue in the next lesson, where we turn to Faraday's law. This law relates the change of electric fields in *space* to produce changes in magnetic fields in *time*. It is because of such relations that we have light waves!\n",
