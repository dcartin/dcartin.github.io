Taking the limit $\\Delta t \\to 0$ gives the instantaneous velocity and acceleration; in graph terms, this would be the slope at a particular time on a position vs. time or velocity vs. time graph, respectively. Up until now, we have focused more on understanding what velocity and acceleration mean, and how to code them into a computer simulation.\n",

    "Our next step is to view these quantities from a more mathematical side. Building from the basic definitions, we will see that there are equations that relate them to each other. Specifically, we will assume constant acceleration, and see where that takes us. In particular, we will go through the important examplem of free fall, where an object is moving along a vertical line due to the gravitational field. You have seen how to simulate this in vPython in [Lesson 05](accel); in this lesson, we will focus more on the calculational side. Then, if we wish, we can use the kinematic equations to verify the results we obtain in our simulations.\n",

    "These are exact when the acceleration of an object is constant. Even when the acceleration is *not* constant, these kinematic equations are the basis for everything we will be doing in computational physics. You have already seen how the first two allow us to update the position and velocity of a moving object. Later in the course, in Lesson 20, you will see how the last three provide a helpful window into the idea of work and energy. Understanding how to use these in various applications will be very important for you!\n",
