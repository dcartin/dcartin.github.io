    "# Rotational kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 05, we discussed the kinematic equations for linear motion. These describe the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration, for an object moving with a constant linear acceleration. In other words, if an object is moving along a line, with a constant rate of change for the velocity, then the linear kinematic equations will tell you all about this motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to explore the version of this for circular motion. This could be something actually moving along a circular path -- think of a car driving on a race track -- or a rotating motion -- such as a rock stuck in the treads of a tire. Note, by the way, that I will use the words \"rotational\" and \"angular\" fairly interchangeably, but if I were strict about it, the rock on the tire is a \"rotation\", while the car is changing in angle, at least as seen by a person at the center of the track. In any case, for these two types of situation, there are angular versions of position, velocity, and acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also angular versions of the kinematic equations as well. In fact, we can go from the linear kinematic equations to the angular versions, simply by replacing each linear quantity with its angular partner. The reason for this is that we define angular velocity and acceleration pretty much the same way as we did linear velocity and acceleration. Thus, the angular kinematic equations can be built up from these basic definitions, much as was done in Lesson 05.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this is to consider the angular motion as simply a line \"wrapped in a circle\". In fact, one of the key ideas of this lesson is how to directly relate the angle an object rotates through, and the distance traveled by a point on the edge of this object. This will directly give a relationship between thinking of angles and rotation, versus thinking of moving along the circumference of a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define angular position, velocity, and acceleration.\n",
    "* State the corresponding angular kinematic equation for a given linear kinematic equation.\n",
    "* Calculate time, or angular position, velocity, or, acceleration using rotational kinematic equations."

    "## Angular quantities and units\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the rotational kinematic equations, we need to define our basic quantities first. To start with, we will define the rotational versions of position and displacement. After we do this, we will need to consider what units to measure our angular quantities in. It turns out that there is a best choice of units, which we will talk about later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Angle and angular displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to talking about the car driving around a circular track. What does an observer at the center of the track see? This person sees the car moving around the track with a changing angle, relative to a fixed angle (the \"reference line\" $\\theta = 0$). This is a lot like the origin ${\\vec r} = 0$ of a system of coordinates, but we are only considering motion along a circle. Then, the person at the track center sees the car at an **angular position** $\\theta$ at each instant of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like we defined a (linear) displacement $\\Delta {\\vec r}$ as the change in position ${\\vec r}$, we can also define an **angular displacement** $\\Delta \\theta$, for the change in angle over the course of some motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Delta \\theta = \\theta_f - \\theta_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, much like linear displacement, for angular displacement, we do not care how the motion was carried out, just what are the initial angle $\\theta_i$ and final angle $\\theta_f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Angular displacement of a point on the edge of a disk](../img/INT_AY21_L21_Fig01_Ang_displacement.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like angular momentum, the angular displacement is actually a *vector*. To see this, think about the rotation of an object. It will rotate in some flat plane, and we can define the vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\theta}$ to point perpendicular to this plane. We will not worry about this aspect of the angular displacement too much, but it can be important in some applications in engineering. However, the vector nature of $\\Delta {\\vec \\theta}$ does give us a convention for the signs: since we think of increasing angles when we travel around the unit circle in a counterclockwise direction, this will be the *positive* direction for $\\Delta \\theta$, and *negative* will be in the clockwise direction."

    "Now let's talk about the units we will use for angular displacement. Remember that these units will \"filter down\" to give us the units for angular velocity, and angular acceleration, since we will define angular velocity in terms of angular displacement (much like we did for linear displacement and velocity). So what should we choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a circular object in rotation, and you want to compare the *linear* motion of a point on the edge of the circle to its *angular* motion. Starting at the reference point, the linear distance along the circle edge is known as the **arc length** $s$. Hopefully it is obvious that if you double the angle $\\theta$, you double the arc length $s$ along the circle (tangential to it), so the two are proportional. This is denoted by the equation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    s \\sim \\theta\n",

    "$$\n",
    "s = r \\theta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have made the choice of proportionality constant $k$ to be the radius of the circle. We call these units **radians** (abrbeviated \"rad\"). This gives us a nice interpretation of what a radian is: one radian is the angle for which the arc length is equal to the radius of the circle. Notice this simple equation only works when we make this choice!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** Suppose instead you decide to use degrees, so that one circumference of the circle matches 360 degrees. What would the relationship between arc length $s$ and angle $\\theta$ be then?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Although radians will be our default units, other kinds of angular units will appear. For example, one **revolution** (rev) is one complete trip in a circle, so it is equivalent to $2 \\pi$ radians. Similarly, this is the same as an angular displacement of 360$^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The secret conversion factor:** Remember above that I said that if you travel one radius along the edge of a circle with that radius, you have traveled through an angular displacement of one radian? It turns out that this is a good way to interpret the $r$ factor that appears in the equation $s = r \\theta$. This is actually a conversion factor! In other words, in this equation, $r$ has units of \"length/radian\", so you can convert between *angular* displacement $\\theta$ and *linear* displacement $s$. It is helpful to keep this in mind, since units of radians sometimes seem to \"disappear\" without reason. However, this is usually because there is a factor of the circle's radius that is being used to convert angle to length, and vice versa!"

    "In Lesson 06, we derived the linear kinematic equations from the basic definitions of velocity and acceleration. These were then useful in describing the motion of an object. They were really helpful after we talked about Newton's second law. Because of the laws of motion, we could find the acceleration of an object. Then, the linear kinematic equations could find the position and velocity of the object at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the rotational version of the kinematics equations. In the next lesson, we will continue the same path we traveled for the linear case, and find the rotational version of Newton's second law. This will allow us to calculate the angular displacement and velocity of a rotating object, starting from its angular acceleration. From Lesson 19, we have already talked briefly about *torque*, the rotational version of force. The sum of the torques on an object will determine the angular acceleration, as we will see in Lesson 22.\n",
