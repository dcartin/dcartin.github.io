    "This lesson starts with exploring the motion of objects. We will formally define quantities such as displacement and velocity to describe such motion. Later, in [Lesson 05](accel), we will talk about what happens when the velocity changes, due to an acceleration. Since a lot of what we will do in the class will depend on the ideas here, I will spend some time going through the reasoning behind them. In particular, we need to tell the computer how to take an initial position vector and a velocity vector, and update the position accordingly. So I will devote a lot of space to describing the necessary programming; this will built off of what we talked about with vectors in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy).\n",

    "I will also use graphs of the motion to help quantify the motion. Graphs are an important source of information in science and engineering, and it is important that you are comfortable with them. There are some basic methods of reading graphs that you will use over and over. These will be developed in this lesson.\n",

    "As mentioned above, we are going to create a moving object. To be specific, let's create a `sphere` object in vPython. This is done in the Trinket app below, which has a function `createSphere()`. The sphere is a lot like the `arrow` we saw in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy:arrow), but it has some different attributes. Like an arrow, the sphere has a position `pos`, which is where the center of the sphere is located, and a color `color`. As you would probably expect, there is an attribute `radius`; the default value is 1, but I have made it somewhat smaller. In addition, vPython objects have the helpful property that you can add your own custom attributes to any object. I have added the attribute `velocity` to the sphere, to give it a velocity pointing to the right."

    "## Displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up how we will create realistic motion using vPython, we need to get a couple of important definitions under our belt. The first of the quantities we will define is *displacement*; we saw this in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy:vec-add), but we will now define it. The **displacement** is a vector quantity giving the straight-line distance between the starting (${\\vec r}_i$) and ending (${\\vec r}_f$) points, i.e. \"as the crow files\". Thus, it is an easy quantity to work with -- if an object moves through some path, to find the displacement, it does not matter what the path is, just the beginning and end of it. Obviously, objects can move through some very convoluted paths due to forces acting on them, so why is the particular trajectory not important? I can give you two answers for this, depending on the situation. For some, such as a basketball thrown out onto the court, the effect of gravity will result in only *one* possible path from your hands to where the ball lands; if I know the displacement of the ball, I can calculate everything else about the motion (such as time of flight, initial velocity). For other situations, this may not be clear. However, I can think of the complicated path as a big number of small displacements put together, one after the other. This is where using a computer is great -- I can tell the computer what the rules are for each displacement, and it will find the trajectory of the object. An example of this is if I threw a feather out on the basketball court instead. If I tell the computer the rules for both gravity and air resistance, it can find the overall displacement as the sum of a bunch of individual pieces.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, it will be important here to know that vectors have *direction*. Hopefully, you can already see this when you plug numbers into the equation above. If $r_{i, y} = 3$ and $r_{f, y} = 5$, then $\\Delta r_y = 2$, while if the initial and final numbers are reversed, then $\\Delta r_y = -2$. When the displacement $\\Delta r_y$ is *positive*, the object has moved in the positive direction, while the negative displacement means the motion was in the negative direction. So already, you can see how direction will be taken into account in physics quantities.\n",

    "```{margin} Variable types\n",
    "If you are interested in learning more about computer programming, then the point I make here about variable names is an important one. Variables that are defined inside Python procedures and functions are called *local* variables, and are only defined within that group of code; the computer does not know what they are outside of the procedure or function they are originally set in. On the other hand, variables in the main program are called *global* variables, and can be used anywhere inside the program, including the procedures and functions. This is why giving local and global variables the same name can be confusing -- you may want to use a variable in the main program that is only defined inside a function! There are ways around this, but they may make the issue worse if you are not careful.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the program above, I have copied the function `createSphere()` from the first program in this lesson, and changed it slightly. Now, it takes arguments `start_pos` and `start_vel`, the initial position and velocity vectors, respectively. This allows you to play around with these values if you wish, and see how the motion changes. For this particular program, though, I have defined the variables `INIT_POS` and `INIT_VEL` at the top of the program. Note that the variable names here do not have to be the same as those inside the function; in fact, it is a good idea to make them different, since confusing them may cause problems. You will notice I also did this when using `new_sphere` inside the function, but `ball` when calling it in the main program. Also, I like to put my variable definitions all together towards the top of the program, so it is easy to find and change them, if necessary. Along these lines, when I call the function `createSphere()`, I assign it to the variable `ball`, so that the sphere object created in the function, I have a name I can use to change its position later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get into how to change the ball position. The process of changing a variable, based on some mathematical relation, is known as **updating**. Here, we will use the equation we had earlier, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec r}_{n + 1} = {\\vec r}_n + {\\vec v} \\Delta t\n",

    "Remember that the index $n$ here refers to the number of time steps $\\Delta t$ that have passed. In other words, the total time $t = n \\Delta t$. Using the film analogy again, $n$ is the number of movie frames that we have gone through, while $\\Delta t$ is the time between showing each frame on the screen. We have to put this into vPython commands in the program above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with updating the ball position. First, remember from [Lesson 01](intro-py) what it means when we use the command `x = x + 1` in Python: the computer sees what the current value is for the variable `x`, adds one to that value, then puts the new value back into the variable `x`. This command updates the old value `x` to get a new value `x` equal to one greater than the one. We are doing something similar with the equation above: we start with the old value ${\\vec r}_n$ of the ball's position vector, we add ${\\vec v} \\Delta t$ to it, then make that sum the new value ${\\vec r}_{n + 1}$ of the ball position. This guides us in how to update the ball position! With the time step `DT` in the program, we want to use the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that, if you wish, you can abbreviate the command a bit using the Python operator `+=` to write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ball.pos += ball.velocity * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type in either of these commands into the program above, but don't run it yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "This programming command comes straight from the physics definition of velocity. This method of updating the ball position is known as the **Euler method**, where we take an equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{A_{new} - A_{old}}{\\Delta t}\n",

There, you can try to find the actual function for *all* times that satisfies the equation. However, we are doing it *numerically*, using a computer, so we need a method to compute the values at different times. This is why we need a technique like the Euler method.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why don't I want you to run the program yet? Well, notice that the `while` loop will run until the desired time period `MAX_TIME` is complete. But where does the time elapsed `t` get changed in the program? So far, nowhere! Thus, we need to update the time as well.

Instead, the computer is running exactly what you told it to, to change the position `ball.pos` but *not* the time. So the `while` loop never stops, since the condition `t < MAX_TIME` is always satisfied. Don't forget this part!\n",

    "Run the code and see what happens now. Looks like nothing, right? And why is the ball on the right-hand side of the screen? Because computers are very fast, the ball moved so fast that you saw only a flash! To slow down the animation, insert the statement `rate(100)` inside the loop, where it says to set the computer frame rate, indented as usual. This specifies that the `while` loop will not be executed more than 100 times per second, even if your computer is capable of many more than 100 loops per second. The way it works is that each time around the loop VPython checks to see whether 1/100th of a second has elapsed since the previous iteration. If not, VPython waits until that much time has gone by. This ensures that there are no more than 100 iterations performed in one second. Note that this frame rate is different than the one we set ourselves with the value `DT` -- `rate()` sets the number of times the computer shows the results, while `DT` is related to the \"internal clock\" of the simulation itself, i.e. where things stand in terms of the motion there.\n",

Second, you can always figure out what the area is by using the units. Going back to the $v_x$ vs. $t$ graph, with $v_x$ in meters per second and $t$ in seconds, then the area is (m/s)(s) = meters.

    "1. Finally, we don't want the graph to have the vertical axis labeled with $v_x$, since we now have two curves on the same graph. Remove the definition for `ytitle` inside `xGraph`. Instead, inside the definition for `xVelCurve`, add an attribute `label = 'v_x (m/s)'`. For `xPosCurve`, add `label = 'r_x (m)'`.\n",

    "Once you have done all of these steps, run the cell again, and see if the two curves look correct. Your graph should look like the one shown below. The blue velocity curve is a straight, flat line at $v_x = 2$ reflecting the *constant* $x$ velocity component of the ball. On the other hand, the ball starts with an initial $x$ position of $r_x = -3$, and then moves to a final $x$ position of $r_x = +3$ when $t = 3$. Because the $x$ velocity is constant and greater than zero, the red position line has a constant, positive slope.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson has two major pieces. The first part covered displacement, as well as average and instantaneous velocity. These concepts were defined, and various relationships between them laid out. This includes how to get displacement from a velocity vs. time graph, and velocity from a position vs. time graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part covered the vPython package, using it to create a `sphere` object. A good reference for this package is at [vPython.org](http://vpython.org). We talked about the attributes of objects like this, and how they can be defined. Then, from the definition of average velocity, the Euler method enabled us to animate the sphere, so it moved at a constant velocity. This included the use of a `while` loop for updating the position of the sphere. Finally, the position and velocity components of the sphere were graphed using the `graph` and `gcurve` modules in vPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define average velocity and instantaneous velocity.\n",
    "* Describe the Euler method.\n",
    "* Create a sphere in vPython, and update its position.\n",
    "* Create a graph in vPython."
