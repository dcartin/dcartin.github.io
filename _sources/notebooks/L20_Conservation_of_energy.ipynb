    "In the last lesson, we found the work done by any generic force, as the system it acts on undergoes a displacement. This force could be constant (such as the force of gravity near the surface of the Earth) or changing (like the spring force). However, this is not the best way to divide forces, at least when talking about work. Instead, we will see that it is best to focus on those forces where the work done by the force leads to a scalar uniquely defined at every state of the system. This scalar will be known as a *potential energy* of the force, and the force will be known as a *conservative force*. The reason to do this is that if we can associate a specific scalar -- the *mechanical energy* of the system -- based on both kinetic and potential energies, then a constant mechanical energy allows us to predict the evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our gameplan for this lesson is the following. First, we discuss which forces we can define potential energies for. There are a limited number of such forces, but they will be very helpful to use. This means we need to specify the difference between a conservative force and a non-conservative force; a potential energy can only be defined for a conservative force. Then we can add up the kinetic energy and all the potential energies of the system to get the system's mechanical energy. If only conservative forces act on the system, then the mechanical energy is conserved, according to the work-energy theorem of the last lesson. However, if we have non-conservative forces as well, we need to take these into account. That will be the final portion of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define potential energy, and describe its relation to the force done by a conservative force.\n",
    "* Define mechanical energy, and explain when mechanical energy is conserved for a system.\n",
    "* Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system.\n",
    "* Describe the relationship between mechanical energy and the work done by non-conservative forces.\n",
    "* Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system, when non-conservative forces are present.\n",
    "* Given an energy graph for an object, describe the motion of the object."

    "As outlined in the last section, our first step is to see where we can define a potential energy. Before we do that, let's motivate why we can do that in the first place! For some forces, the work done by that force can be \"stored\" in the system. To see what that means, imagine that you have a person skating on a frictionless surface. You can see this by running the PhET app below, selecting \"Intro\", and then moving the person onto the ramp and letting go. The skater will then move along the ramp."

    "If you watch the motion of the skater, you will see that they will continue moving forever. When they start at the top of the ramp, the gravitational force will pull them along the ramp, and they will speed up until they reach the bottom. At that point, as they start moving up the opposite side, gravity will slow them down, until they reach the same height again. But there is no friction, so this process will repeat itself over and over! There is some physical quantity related to gravity that is lost when the skater moves down the ramp, but is gained back in full when going back up the other side.\n",

    "Let's make this idea more general by considering some unknown force ${\\vec F}$ acting on an object. Suppose you take the object and you move it from point $a$ to point $b$ in the figure below, using the long path with the green arrow. You find that the unknown force does 60 J of work on the object. Then you use the shorter path (the red arrow) to move the object back from point $b$ to point $a$. In this case, the force does -60 J of work.\n",

Said a different way, there is *no change* in the energy of the object when it takes a full cycle around the two arrows. This means for this force, there is some quantity that remains the same, regardless of how you go along the path. If we go against the arrows, then the signs of the works flip, but we still get the same net work of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This force is known as a conservative force. A **conservative** force is one where the work done by the force on an object does not depend on the path taken by the object, for given initial and final points -- all the energy put into the system can be gotten back out at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is not true of all forces! Imagine that the force of friction were acting on the object as it followed the two arrows (you can think of this as moving on the surface of a table). Since the force of friction has a constant magnitude, the work done by friction $W_{fr}$ is greater for a larger distance. In addition, the frictional force is always opposing the motion of the object, so the work $W_{fr}$ will be negative, regardless of which arrow you follow. Thus, the force of friction is *not* a conservative force -- you can't get back energy from friction! \n",

    "Let's go through an example, and see how the conservation of mechanical energy works. Suppose a 150. g wooden block is placed on top of a vertical spring, and it comes to rest at a distance of 2.64 cm from the spring's equilibrium point. The block is pushed down a further 5.36 cm, and then released. We are going to find the maximum height the block will momentarily reach over the equilibrium position of the spring.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to realize is that in the middle position, where the block is at rest on the vertical spring, is *not* where the \"energies balance out\". The block is at rest because the net force at this location is zero; if this was not true, the spring and block would start accelerating. Thus, we first need to use Newton's second law here. This will allow us to calculate the spring constant of the vertical spring, which we do not know at this point. The net force on the block is due to the upward force $F_{spr}$ on the block from the spring, as well as the downward force $F_g$ of gravity. Setting the magnitudes of these two forces equal to each other,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum F_y = F_{spr} - F_g = ma_y = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the spring constant $k$ is equal to $k = mg / \\Delta r_y$. Here, $\\Delta r_y$ is the vertical distance from the equilibrium point of the spring to where the block comes to rest, and so $\\Delta r_y = 2.64$ cm (as a magnitude, since we have already taken into account the signs in the equation above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can look at what happens when the block is pushed down further. The net force will *not* be zero here, since the spring force is larger than the block's weight. This is why the block will accelerate upward until it is pushed completely off the spring. Since the spring force depends on the distance the spring is away from its equilibrium, we cannot use the kinematic equations -- the acceleration changes with time, so it is not constant! This is why using the conservation of mechanical energy is the best choice: we only need to know what is happening between the initial state (when the block is pushed down to its lowest point) and the final state (the block has left the spring, so the spring is no longer compressed).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we start with $W_{nc} = 0$ (no friction), and write down the conservation of mechanical energy equation,\n",

    "If we take the initial and final states outlined in the paragraph above, then the block is (momentarily) at rest at both of these points. This means $K_i = K_f = 0$. The spring is also not compressed in the final state, since the block is no longer sitting on it, giving $U_{s, f} = 0$. The block is compressing the spring at the beginning, however, so $U_{s, i} \\neq 0$ from the total compression $r$ of $2.64 + 5.36 = 8.00$ cm from the equilibrium. Last, we turn to the gravitational potential energy. Here we need to make a choice about where to put the reference height. This is different than the choice for the spring potential energy, which was already chosen (when $U_s$ was defined) to be the spring's equilibrium position. Since there is no strong reason to choose one height over another, let's pick the block's final position as the height where $U_g = 0$. This gives $U_{g, f} = 0$ and $U_{g, i} = mgh$, where $h < 0$ is the distance from the starting and ending heights of the block -- negative since the initial position is below the final. Thus, our final energy conservation equation is\n",

    "In the last step, we used the equation for the spring constant $k$ we got earlier when the net force was zero. Note that the mass of the block doesn't matter! Plugging in the numbers, and taking the absolute value, we have $|h| = 12.12$ cm. However, this is the total distance from the initial to the final heights, and we want only the height above the spring's equilibrium point.

Remember in the vertical spring example above, the mass was placed on the spring, and came to rest at a distance of 2.64 cm below the equilibrium of the spring. This would be the point where the total potential energy is the least. I will come back to that point in a bit.\n",

This equilibrium point is known as a **stable equilibrium**: a position where the net force is zero, and where moving a small distance to either side means the system experiences a net force which returns it back to the original point. This is opposed to an **unstable equilibrium**, where the force is zero precisely at the point, but moving just a little bit away gives rise to a net force that amplifies that motion.

Because it tells us what the motion of the mass will look like after we let go of it. Again, as we saw above, when the mass is at $r_{bot}$, the force on it is in the $+y$ direction, so the mass will move upward. On the potential energy graph, as you move to the right, there is a gap between the dashed line for $E$, and the potential energy $U$. What is this gap? It is the difference $E - U$, which is precisely the kinetic energy $K$ of the system! Thus, just from the graph, we can see that the mass will initially speed up with increasing $r_y$. However, once the mass passes the equilibrium point for the system, the gap gets smaller, and the mass will slow down. Eventually, the mechanical energy $E$ of the system will equal the potential energy $U$ at the vertical distance $r_{top}$. At this point, the mass will stop, and then start moving downward.

You might think adding a spatial dimension would make the graphs more complicated (since they would now be three dimensional!). In general, this is the case, but it turns out things remain relatively simple if we consider only central forces, which we talked about in [Lesson 16](UCM:cent-force) and [Lesson 18](ang-mom:cent-force).

    "Notice that we now have another way to explain why the ball never goes closer to the center than some fixed radius. Remember, when I first introduced this central force in [Lesson 16](UCM:cent-force), I described this inner radius in terms of the constant central force ${\\vec F}_c$ versus the necessary centripetal force to keep it in circular motion. There, for radii $r$ when $F_c - mv^2 /r < 0$, the net acceleration is not enough to keep it moving in a circle, so the radial velocity component $v_r$ will slow down, until the object stops moving inward at the inner radius, and starts moving outward. Using what we have talked about in this lesson, we can express this same process, but in terms of energy. As the ball approaches the inner radius, an increasing amount of its mechanical energy $E$ is in the perpendicular piece $L^2 / 2mr^2$ of the kinetic energy, while the radial part $(1/2) mv^2 _r$ will decrease in size. Eventually, there is no available energy for the radial portion, so $v_r = 0$, and the ball turns around. The turning points of the ball (both inner and outer) are when the mechanical energy $E$ equals the effective potential energy $U_{eff}$.

However, when I talk about the *effective* potential energy, I am talking about two dimensional motion, since $U_{eff}$ includes the angular momentum of the object moving perpendicular to the radial direction.

    "Energy methods are one of the most powerful techniques in physics. Notice that it is all in one equation! That is one of the advantages of using conservation of energy. In fact, if you decide to pursue physics as a major, you will see that many of the more advanced methods you will see are just different versions of writing down the mechanical energy of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flip slide, though, is that all the energies are scalars, so information about direction is lost. For example, you can use mechanical energy to find the speed of an object at a given position, but not its velocity, since you cannot determine the drection using a scalar. However, with that being said, you can learn a lot from using the conservation of mechanical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define mechanical energy.\n",
    "* State the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.\n",
    "* Use the change in mechanical energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity such as the speed or position of an object at a particular time.\n",
    "* State the relationship between a conservative force, and the slope of the force's potential energy vs. position graph.\n",
    "* Define the effective potential energy of a system."
