    "Our current understanding of how physics works at a fundamental level is that there are four distinct interactions that explain all phenomena. Two of these operate only at the subatomic level, so we don't have direct experience with them. These are the weak nuclear force -- the reason that radioactive nuclei decay -- and the strong nuclear force -- which is why nuclei stay together the rest of the time! However, these forces act over distances of $10^{-15}$ m or less, so we only see their effects only indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we will study two fundamental interactions that can act over any distance, because they are represented by inverse square laws. The first of these, gravitation, we looked at in [Lesson 21](grav). We now turn to the second, the electrostatic force, as given by Coulomb's law. Much like gravity, the force between stationary electric chargess varies as $1/r^2$. So while it does decrease with larger distance, the force never goes exactly to zero. However, unlike the masses of gravitation, electric charges come in positive and negative varieties. Thus, in most practical applications, the equal number of positive and negative charges in most matter reduces the size of the electrostatic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why I keep using \"electrostatic\" as the name of the force, rather than \"electric\". It turns out that when the electric charges are moving, the situation gets more complicated. First, a moving electric charge will create magnetic effects as well. However, the electric effects of the charge do not go away! To treat problems like this properly, one needs to combine both electricity and magnetism into an electromagnetic effect. It was James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, who first worked out how to do so towards the end of the 19th century. So, I should really be calling this fundamental interaction \"eletromagnetism\", rather than splitting off the electrostatic force by itself. However, treating elecromagnetism as a whole makes it more complicated! For now, we look at the simpler case of stationary electric charges.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The constant $G$ gives the strength of the gravitational interaction between *any* two masses in the Universe. Making this number bigger or smaller would change the force of gravity between all pairs of objects exactly the same.\n",
    "1. For a *given* object, its mass $m$ describes how it is affected by the gravitational fields of all other objects. Unlike $G$, we can change the mass of a single object, without affecting the masses of any other objects. Changing the mass of an object only changes the magnitude of the gravitational force on it.\n",

    "When we talk about the electrostatic force, we will see this same type of structure. For now, let's just focus on the electric analogue of the mass. This is known as the **charge** of an object. The charge $q$ of an object is a measure of how that object is affected by the electrostatic force on the object, due to all other charges. Charge has units of coulombs (C).\n",

This gives the same overall minus sign we had with the gravitational force. If the product $q_i q_j$ > 0 (i.e. both positive or both negative charges), then the force is repulsive.

In some ways, this will be the same process as what we did with gravitation, but the effect of the charges will have an influence as well.

    "We have now discussed two of the long-range fundamental forces in the Universe: gravitation and the electrostatic force. They are similar in form and both rely on the unit vectors ${\\hat r}_{ij}$. However, there is an important difference between the possible directions of the two forces, due to the positive and negative signs of electric charges, as opposed to mass always being positive. The force of gravity is always attractive, while the electrostatic force can be repulsive or attractive.\n",
