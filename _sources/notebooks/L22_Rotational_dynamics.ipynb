    "Remember that, from Newton's first law of linear motion, you can think of the mass of an object as its resistance to linear acceleration -- the larger the mass, the more force it takes to get the same acceleration. Thus, we need to find what measures an object's resistance to rotation. This will be known as the \"moment of inertia\" $I$ of an object. A crucial point will be that the shape of the object matters just as much as its mass. After we define this quantity, we can then write down the rotational version of Newton's second law, and apply it to various situations.\n",

Tight-rope walking (or \"funambulism\") crucially involves maximizing the resistance to rotational motion, so that the walker does not rotate to the side and falls off the wire.

    "Much like mass gives a measure of inertia, or resistance to linear motion, moment of inertia gives a measure of resistance to rotational motion -- the larger the moment of inertia $I$, the more difficult it is to get an object to start rotating. As mentioned above, we will see that where the mass is will matter just as much as what the mass is. In fact, in situations where the mass cancels out (as we say with inclined planes in Lessons 14 and 16, for example), the only important factor will be the distribution of the mass. Thus, a hoop, a ball, and a disk may all have the same mass, but their mass is arranged differently, so they will have different moments of inertia.\n",

This explains how the moment of inertia can vary, depending on which axis you rotate the object around. You can try this yourself using a cell phone (don't drop it!) or a book.

However, these two motions do *not* have to be related! Suppose you are driving on an icy road, where there is no friction between the tire and the road. You can press the gas all you want, so $\\alpha > 0$, but the lack of friction means that the tire will continue with a constant velocity (so $a = 0$). The tire is slipping on the road, so the linear and angular motions are separate.\n",

    "We have now combined together all of the rotational versions of physical quantities we had seen in their linear incarnations. In particular, we can relate the rotation of an object -- in terms of its angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration -- to the net torque acting on it. The relation between net torque and angular acceleration is made exact by defining the moment of inertia, the resistance of an object to rotational motion. The object's net torque will then change its angular momentum. These descriptions exactly mirror the corresponding relations between linear quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the situations given above, it is easy to construct scenarios where both angular and linear motion happen at the same time. Historically, understand a way to couple these two types of motion was important in the development of more efficient machinery, such as conversion of the rotation of an axel attached to a water wheel into the linear motion of a tool, such as a hammer, in a factory.\n",
