    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some discomfort with Newton's first law of motion, it's probably because of the widespread presence of frictional forces in our everyday lives. Whenever we roll a ball along a table, the ball will eventually stop, not because that is the \"natural\" motion of all objects, but because of friction between the ball and the table. This was one of the difficult mental leaps that had to be made to go from the thoughts of Aristotle and the ancient Greeks, to the modern viewpoint on physics: motion stops because there are forces present that cause this stop, *not* because the \"natural state\" of an object is always at rest. This flip between viewpoints allows us to describe in detail the forces that cause motion to change, rather than throwing up our hands and saying it's the way things are.\n",

    "\n",
    "This leads us into the specific force of friction as our next topic. Leonardo da Vinci was one of the first people to systematically examine the size of the frictional force. In a series of experiments, he showed that friction does not depend on the contact area between the two surfaces, and that increasing the load on an object will increase the frictional force proportionally. However, although his discoveries were written into his notebooks, these were not publicly known until hundreds of years later.\n",

    "da Vinci's laws of friction were rediscovered by the French instrument maker and physicist Guillaume Amontons around 1700, and hence are often called \"Amontons' laws\". These rules were verified by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (whom we will see later with the electrostatic force) about eight decades later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frictional force is a complicated area of study, and researchers are continuing to look into its properties. This is because, not only is it interesting, but it has obvious industrial and engineering applications. We will examine only a simple model of friction here.\n",

    "* State the relationship between the frictional force and the normal force.\n",
    "* State the maximum value of the static frictional force.\n",

    "## Friction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are rearranging the furniture in your living room, and decide you want to move your couch. You give it a push to slide it along the carpet in the room. To make things definite, let's make it a couch with a weight of 2.00 kN, and you start out by applying a force of 200. N to the couch. It doesn't move, so you push harder with 400. N. It still doesn't move, so you push with 600. N. Still doesn't move. You activate those honed muscles of yours and push with 800. N, which is finally enough to get the couch to move. Not only does it move, but it starts accelerating across the living room! So, you push with only 600. N, and (unlike before), the couch now moves at a constant velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you can think of some situation like this, where you have to apply a force to get something to start moving. Once you do get it moving, you need less force to *keep* it moving. This shows that there are two separate types of frictional force.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **static frictional force** acts on an object when it is stationary relative to the surface it is sitting on. Notice that they may be moving together -- think of a crate in the flatbed of a pickup truck, for example.\n",
    "* The **kinetic frictional force** acts on an object moving relative to the surface it is on. This may be due to the object moving on a stationary surface, or the other way around. The magnitude of the kinetic frictional force is usally less than that of the static frictional force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the couch in the example above starts moving, then only the kinetic frictional force is acting on it. Before that, however, your applied force is opposed by the *static* frictional force. Note how it changed! As you increased the applied force, the static frictional force matches it, at least up to a point. Beyond that maximum, though, friction was not strong enough to prevent the couch from moving, and now the kinetic friction was involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, da Vinci, Amontons, Coulomb, and others started a detailed study of the properties of the friction force. Their model of friction, described in this lesson, has two basic properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The direction of the frictional force ${\\vec F}_{fr}$ is always opposing the motion of an object, or the potential motion, if the object is at rest.\n",
    "* The magnitude $F_{fr}$ of the frictional force on an object on a surface is proportional to the normal force due to the surface, acting on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about these in more detail, starting with the direction. Think again to the example mentioned earlier of a crate in a flatbed truck. As the truck drives along, if the flatbed's surface were completely smooth, the crate would have no horizontal force on it, and it would slide backwards. To keep the crate in place, the static frictional force acts opposite to this motion, in the direction the truck is moving. This is what I mean by opposing the potential motion of the object. Thus, it is actually the frictional force moving the crate forward!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the magnitude, since the force of friction is always proportional to the normal force, then it makes sense to look at the ratio of the frictional and normal forces; this will be a constant, known as $\\mu$ (\"mu\"). Thus, the coefficient $\\mu$ is the ratio of the two magnitudes, or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mu = \\frac{F_{fr}}{F_N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, since $\\mu$ is the ratio of two forces, it has no units! This constant is roughly the same for a given type of friction (static or kinetic) with any pair of surfaces, e.g. rubber on carpet, for someone walking in their house with shoes on. There will be a **coefficient of static friction** $\\mu_s$ and a **coefficient of kinetic friction** $\\mu_k$ for each such surface pair. These coefficients must be measured experimentally, by going into the lab and moving the two surfaces against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now get specific about the relationship between the normal and friction forces. Remember the example we had above, with the couch. Specfically, the static frictional force would change, since you altered your applied force. Thus, the force of static friction will actually have a *range* of values, up to some maximum static frictional force. To show this, the magnitude of $F_{fr, s}$ is given by an inequality; the static frictional force is limited by its largest magnitude. Mathematically, this is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\t\tF_{fr, s} \\le \\mu_s F_N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, as before, $F_{fr, s}$ is the force of static friction, $\\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction, and $F_N$ is the normal force. On the other hand, the kinetic frictional force is constant, so it is a straight equality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\t\tF_{fr, k} = \\mu_k F_N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_k$ is the force of kinetic friction, and $\\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction.\n",
    "\n",
