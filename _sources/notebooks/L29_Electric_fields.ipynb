    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The physicist of today is well versed in the use of Newton's second law and forces acting on an object. However, these methods are restricted to physical objects (balls rolling down ramps), and do not map over to other situations. In fact, it is much easier to deal with electricity and magnetism when using a more general idea, known as a *field*. It was this conceptual leap in the mid-19th century that eventually set the stage for the quantum mechanical revolution of the early 20th century. Thus, the fundamental theories of physics are written as quantum field theories (and not \"force theories\"!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a field was developed by two great scientists -- the experimentalist Michael Faraday, and the theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Faraday, a self-taught physicist, was the first to lay out a vision of electric and magnetic phenomena arising from ''lines of force'' -- physical tubes forming space and affecting the motion of charged particles moving through space. This was more of a philosophical viewpoint on experimental results, rather than a systematic picture. Then, Maxwell developed a more mathematical framework, writing down what are now known as Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields. These equations were the inspiration for much of modern physics, including Einstein's theory of special relativity, and the quantum field theories used to explain interactions at the subatomic scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen the gravitational field, as a different way of describing the influence of gravity on the motion of an object. In this lesson, we do the same thing for charged objects, developing the electric field from the electrostatic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since electric fields are something that many do not have a good intuitive feel for, it may be helpful here to remember what the idea of a field is. I like to do this with the following analogy. Suppose you need to buy some bread, in order to make sandwiches. You go to the store, and see that loaves of bread are on sale for \\$2 per loaf. This will be the price that everyone agrees on (no haggling allowed!). So how many loaves are you buying? If you are making sandwiches just for yourself, one loaf will probably last you the week; you will have to spend \\$2. However, if you need to feed the entire battalion, you may need to buy 100 loaves, and use \\$200 to do so. The *price* you pay for the bread is different if you get different amounts, but the *price per loaf* always stays the same! This is the idea behind a field. Everyone agrees on the size of the gravitational field (force per kilogram -- same as the price per loaf), but different objects have different forces (total price), since they have different masses. We will see the same idea carries over to electric fields, which will be force per charge, instead of per mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State the definition of the electric field in terms of the electrostatic force on a test charge, and identify its units.\n",
    "* Describe the relationship between the direction of the electric field and the direction of the electric force on a point charge.\n",
    "* State the equation for the electric field created by a point charge."

    "Throughout this lesson, we will use the gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ as a stepping stone to understanding the electric field ${\\vec E}$. It may help to go back to gravitational fields in [Lesson 21](grav:field) where we talked about ${\\vec g}$ in some detail. Remember that the gravitational field is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec g} = \\frac{{\\vec F}_g}{m}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the *test mass* used to measure the gravitational field at its location. The gravitational field at this location gives a measure of the influence at that point of all the surrounding masses. The idea is to \"factor out\" the size of the test mass, so that we are only measuring the gravitational effects of all these other masses around the test mass' location. Note that the gravitational *force* ${\\vec F}_g$ and the gravitational *field* ${\\vec g}$ always point in the same direction, since the mass $m > 0$ for all objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now define the **electric field** in the same way, by analogy -- using a **test charge** $q$ instead of mass $m$, and electrostatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ instead of gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantity:** electric field\n",
    "* **Symbol:** ${\\vec E}$\n",
    "* **Definition:** The electric field at a given location is found by dividing the electrostatic force on a test charge at that location by the test charge.\n",

    "    {\\vec E} = \\frac{{\\vec F}_e}{q}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SI units:** newtons per coloumb (or N/C)\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to think conceptually about what we are doing: we want to find a quantity ${\\vec E}$ that gives the influence of a collection of charges at a particular point $P$, so we place a test charge $q$ at this point $P$. However, we want our answer ${\\vec E}$ not to depend on what test charge we use, so we \"factor out\" the size of the charge $q$ from the electrostatic force. Thus, if you use a large, positive test charge, and I use a small, negative test charge, the electrostatic forces on our charges will be different, but the electric field ${\\vec E}$ we measure will be exactly the *same*!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the direction of the electric field first. We can use the definition of the electric field to find the direction of the electric field, due to a single charge $Q$. In particular, suppose there is a charge $Q > 0$ creating an electric field we want to measure. You use your positive test charge $q_+$ to find the electrostatic force on your charge, as seen in the picture below. Since both charges are positive, the test charge is repelled from the charge $Q$. Then you divide the electrostatic force $F_e$ on $q_+$ by the charge $q_+$ (using the definition of electric field above) to get the electric field at the point you placed the test charge. Because $q_+ > 0$, the electrstatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ and the electric field ${\\vec E}$ point in the same direction -- away from $Q$.\n",

    "After you do that, I decide to check your answer by using my negative test charge $q_-$. Again, I find the electrostatic force on $q_-$ due to $Q$, and then divide out by $q_-$ to get ${\\vec E}$. Since $q_- < 0$, the two charges now attract, but dividing the force vector by a negative number gives an electric field that points in the opposite direction. But this is the same direction that you found with your positive test charge! Everyone agrees on the size and direction of the electric field, regardless of what test charge they use to measure it.\n",

    "Now let's talk about an important special case. The definition given above for the electric field works for *any* situation, such as an extended charge (such as a charged disk or rod). Frequently, however, we will only need to find the electric field due to one or more point charges $Q$. Thus, we can start with Coulomb's law for the electrostatic force between two charges. We will find the field a distance $d$ away from charge $Q$ by placing a test charge $q$ there, at a point I will call $P$, and find the electrostatic force on it. I use $d$ instead of $r$ for the distance, so we do not confuse it with the unit vector ${\\hat r}_{PQ}$. The situation is shown in the diagram below.\n",

    "A very helpful way of showing the strength and direction of the electric field in a region of space is by drawing the **field lines**. These are a pictorial representation of the electric field, much like a contour map shows the altitude of a surface. Using electric field lines is helpful is gauging both the direction of the field, as well as the relative strength of the field, at various locations. To start, it may be helpful to think of this first in terms of the gravitational field, something we are more familiar with, so I will use this as an example to build up to electric field lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we all learned in the cradle, the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth is 9.81 m/s$^2$ pointing downward (there are actually small variations, but we will ignore those). What this means is that if I throw a test mass into the air anywhere on the Earth's surface, then ignoring air resistance, the acceleration of that mass will be downward. If I have a bunch of such test masses, and I draw arrows showing the gravitational field at each of them, it would look like the picture below.\n",

Instead, they give the direction of the gravitational field, which in turn tells you about the acceleration of the object. You can see that by running the program below. The cyan arrows represent the constant gravitational field lines near the ground. On the ball itself, the magenta arrow shows the ball's velocity, and the white arrow its acceleration. The white arrow will always match the field at that location, but the trajectory of the ball is not straight down because of its non-zero $v_x$ component.\n",

    "The Trinket app below shows the relation between the gravitational field lines, and the motion of a projectile. We have seen this case in [Lesson 04](accel:vpy-freefall), when we considered projectile motion. Near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational field is constant, which tells us the *acceleration* of a ball, but not the *velocity*. Thus, if you run the simulation below, you will see that the ball does not move directly along the gravitational field vectors, but instead those vectors give the direction of the ball's acceleration."

    "Now we turn to drawing the electric field lines due to various charges. The logic is the same as for the gravitational field lines given above -- we imagine placing test charges at many locations in space, and uses the electric field vectors at each of these locations to map out the continuous electric field lines. If we do this around a single positive charge, and then a single negative charge, the resulting electric field lines look like the two figures below.\n",

    "First, the direction of the field lines is the same as what we said earlier: towards a negative charge, and away from a positive charge. In addition, the field lines get further apart as you move away from each charge. Remember that the electric field is an inverse square law, so that the magnitude $E \\sim 1/r^2$. Thus, the fact that the field lines spread apart is a visual indication that the electric field magnitude is getting *smaller* with *increasing* distance $r$. Finally, since the electric field measured by a test charge placed at a particular point can only point in a single direction, that will be the direction of the electric field line going through the same point. In other words, electric field lines cannot cross, since this uniqueness would be violated.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the introduction of this lesson, the concept of fields is the basis of much of modern physics. We had previously seen the gravitational field. The \"9.81 m/s$^2$\" you have memorized is just the magnitude of the Earth's gravitational field near its surface; however, such fields are present everywhere in the Universe. Now we have a similar idea for the electric field. Because most things do not have a net charge, electric fields are not as ubiquitous as the gravitational variety. However, for a great range of technological devices, it is important to know something about these fields. For example, in some applications, you want to shield your electronics from too large of a field, to avoid failure; in other places, you are interested in creating as large a field as possible, to increase the signal strength for your communications or detection devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet we are really only talking about one aspect of the combination \"electromagnetism\", where both electric and magnetic fields are used together. We have already seen electric fields, and built up some intuition about them, starting from our everyday experience with the gravitational field. We will now complete this picture by introducing magnetic fields in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State the direction of the electric field due to a point charge.\n",
    "* Calculate the electric field at a specified point due to a collection of charges.\n",
    "* Interpret the electric field lines of a given situation."
