    "\n",
    "The gravitational force played an important role in the history of physics. It was in Newton's seminal book, known today as the *Principia*, where he worked out the implications of his laws of motion, and one of the pivotal cases was that of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. This provided the first evidence that motion near the Earth's surface, and motion of objects in the sky, obeyed the same physical laws. This was a game changer in the world of ideas, and led to the mathematical framework for an understanding of the Universe we now call \"physics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, Newton, in the Western scientific tradition one of the earliest influential theories of why objects fall towards the Earth was developed by Aristotle (in the 4th century BC), who thought that all substances have a natural place in the Universe (with the Earth at its center), and objects will move to this place based on their composition. There is no gravitational force yet! The Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta in the 7th century wrote about an actual force of attraction between the Earth and other objects, pulling them towards the Earth's surface. He saw the Earth as a sphere, and that the attraction would be the same for all points on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will talk more about in [Lesson 23](orbits), in the early 17th century Johannes Kepler used new astronomical observations to deduce the motions of the planets based on the idea of having the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In that lesson, we will show how Newton's law of universal gravitation -- developed in this lesson -- leads to a description of planetary motion in the Solar System.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Isaac Newton formulated a notion of a gravitational force between two objects which acts along the line between them, based on an idea of Robert Hooke and others. Using this gravitational force, Newton was able to explain why Kepler's laws of planetary motion worked. A key part of the process was Newton's realization that the force of gravity pulling objects towards the Earth is *exactly* the same force as that keeping the Moon in orbit around the Earth, and both in orbit around the Sun.\n",

    "* State the definition of gravitational field.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to write down Newton's law of universal gravitation, it may be helpful to review some notation; this is similar to notation we defined back in [Lesson 02](vec-vPy:rel-pos) when we first looked at relative position vectors. First, remember that an object's position is defined by a vector ${\\vec r}$, which points from the origin (i.e. ${\\vec r} = {\\vec 0}$) to the object. For more than one object, we can label these position vectors as we do the objects, as seen in the diagram below. In this diagram, there are two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$, with corresponding position vectors ${\\vec r}_1$ and ${\\vec r}_2$.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Now, suppose we want to define an interaction between the two objects, which does depend on our choice of origin, but only the relative position of the objects. This is what is needed for central forces, such as the gravitational force (for this lesson) as well as the electrostatic force (in [Lesson 24](electrostatic-force) for Coulomb's law). In both of these cases, the direction of the force is on the line connecting the two objects, either towards the other object (for attractive forces) or away (for repulsion). The choice of origin should not matter -- these forces are the same, regardless of how the coordinates are picked. To this end, we can define the relative position vectors\n",

Because of these definitions, ${\\vec r}_{12} = -{\\vec r}_{21}$.\n",

    "### The universal force of gravitation\n",

This quantity ${\\vec F}_{g, ij}$ is the gravitational force on object $i$, due to object $j$; this ordering matches our definition of the unit vector ${\\hat r}_{ij}$ at the mass $i$. If we flip the ordering of $i$ and $j$, we flip the sign of the unit vector, while everything else stays the same, so that ${\\vec F}_{g, ji} = -{\\vec F}_{g, ij}$. Both masses $m_i$ and $m_j$ appear in exactly the same way in the equation, i.e. you can reverse them and get the same magnitude, although as stated in the last point, the direction would reverse. This is what we would expect from Newton's third law. \n",

    "The size of the force depends on the inverse of the square of the center-to-center distance $r_{ij}$ between the two masses. This is known as an **inverse square law**. The force magnitude gets smaller as the distance gets larger, and vice versa. The electrostatic force is another example of an inverse square law. For physics in three spatial dimensions, an inverse square law is a sure sign of a force that has an infinite range!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the sign in front of the equation is probably confusing. If we look at the grouping $-{\\hat r}_{ij}$, we see that the gravitational force on mass $i$ always points towards mass $j$; the force is *attractive*. Said differently, since ${\\hat r}_{ij}$ always points away from the other mass, the minus sign tells us the force points towards the other mass. Note that this depends on the rest of the equation being positive! We will see a very similar form for the electrostatic force in [Lesson 24(Coulomb's law)](electrostatic-force), but since electric charges can be negative, the electrostatic force can be either attractive or repulsive.\n",

Well, here's the reason! My experience when starting with gravitational force (or electrostatic forces in [Lesson 24](electrostatic-force)) is that students get confused about the directions of the forces, because they are not taking Newton's zeroth law into account! *We only care about the forces acting on mass 1*. I often see students answering questions like this by telling me about the forces on $m_2$ and $m_3$; those are irrelevant!

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravitational force was one of the first examples of forces we worked with in [Lesson 13 (solving force problems)](force-prob). However, at that point, we leaned heavily on the fact that the gravitational field is close to constant on the Earth's surface, and used that fact to \"define\" the force of gravity on an object. We have now reached the point where we can define the gravitational force between *any* two point masses, not just the Earth and another (small) mass. If we were so inclined, we could built up the force between arbitrary objects by thinking of each of them as made of a collection of small masses. You may see something like that later in your academic career.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravitational force is the only truly long-range force in the Universe. We will see in [Lesson 24](electrostatic-force) that Coulomb's law for the electrostatic force has a similar form. But in practice, because there are both positive and negative charges, the electrostatic force tends to cancel out over large distances, and it does not have too much of an effect on astronomical scales. This is different than gravity, which is the force keeping the planets of the Solar System around the Sun, and the stars in our Milky Way galaxy in their spiral structure. Even the evolution of the Universe in time depends primarily on how gravity affects all the objects in it!\n",
    "\n",
    "We also fleshed out the idea of a field, using the gravitational field as our first example. Remember to focus on the key ideas behind what a field is -- a field measures the influence of an object on its surroundings. We say that falling objects have an acceleration  of 9.81 m/s$^2$ downward because that is the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth. This depends only on the mass and size of the Earth, not on the object's mass. If we lived on another planet, we would remember another number for the magnitude, because the gravitational field would be different. However, this is also dependent on the physical properties of our environment. There are some spiders, for example, that use the electrostatic force for help getting from one plant to another. A physics class for intelligent spiders would memorize the size of the electric field at the Earth's surface!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields are fundamental to our modern understanding of how physics works. Not only do they make the mathematics simpler, but they get at the heart of why objects have the properties that they do. Whenever you hear a physicist talk about a \"quantum field theory\", they are thinking about using fields to describe the basic properties of matter. Fields are both powerful, and a natural way to describe the nature of the Universe.\n",

    "* Calculate the gravitational force between two objects.\n",
