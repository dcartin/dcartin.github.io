    "The intuitive idea behind magnetic flux is essentially the same as that for electric flux: we are now counting the number of *magnetic* field lines that pass through a surface. Thus, again, we want to know how much of the field is perpendicular to the surface, and therefore the field that is *parallel* to the surface's normal vector ${\\hat n}$. This gives a definition of **magnetic flux** ${\\Phi_B}$ that looks a lot like that for electric flux.\n",

This is different than electric field lines, which start and stop on charged objects. Because magnetic field lines never begin or end, then for a *closed* surface (i.e. a gaussian surface), there are always the same number of magnetic field lines going into the closed surface as there are coming out. This means that Gauss' law for *magnetism* says that the magnetic flux through a gaussian surface is zero!\n",

As it moves, it passes from a region with no magnetic field into a region with a constant magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ of 7.05 mT pointing into the page.
