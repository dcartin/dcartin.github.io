    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now begin to analysis circuits, computing various physical quantities for the elements in the circuit. So far, you have only been introduced to batteries and resistors, so our circuits will be constructed only from those devices in this lesson. Later, in Lesson 33 (capacitor circuits), we will add in another element type, the capacitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to go about circuit analysis. One method, which we will talk more about in Lesson 32 (complex circuits), is to use Kirchhoff's laws to write down a set of equations mathematically describing the relationships between the currents and voltages in the circuit. That is a powerful technique, but sometimes it is more than is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will use the method of simplification. We take a group of resistors, and find a single equivalent resistor that has the exact same electrical properties as the original group; then, we can \"replace\" the group with the equivalent resistor, leading to a simpler circuit. If we do this over and over, eventually a circuit with a single resistor -- equivalent to all the resistors in the original circuit -- and the battery. At this point, we can use Ohm's law, since that relation only works for a single resistor. Undoing the process, we can calculate the properties of the original, physical resistors. This will be the scheme we use in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful way to understand many of the concepts in resistor circuits is to build your own circuits! You can do this easily using the Circuit Construction Kit PhET linked in the cell below. I would highly recommend giving it a try! The \"Intro\" allows you to build your own circuits; the \"Lab\" allows you to make more realistic circuits, since it includes the possibility of internal resistance for batteries and wires."

We call the resistance of the equivalence resistor $R_{eq}$, and use Ohm's law to set it equal to $R_{eq} = V_{tot} / I$.

    "## Hybrid circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have taken a single group of resistors, either in series or parallel, and replaced them with a single eqiuivalent resistor. However, there is no reason we cannot keep doing this process over and over. This will allow us to treat more involved circuits. It *does* depend on the ability to group resistors together in series or parallel. If we cannot do this, we will need to use a more sophisticated method, which we will see in Lesson 32 when we use Kirchhoff's laws. I will refer to circuits were you *can* group all the resistors repeatedly into series or parallel groups as a **hybrid circuit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's consider the circuit diagram shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An example hybrid circuit](../img/INT_AY20_MP3_L13_Fig01_Hybrid_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step we need to take is to describe the circuit -- what resistors can we group together as either series or parallel? Going back to the definition of branches and junctions from Lesson 30 may be helpful here. For example, the four resistors are *not* all in series, because they are not all on the same branch. There are, in fact, three branches and two junctions. The junctions are where the wires meet, above and below the battery, so the branches are the left-hand wire, the middle wire, and the right-hand wire. This means that the resistors on the same branch are in series. Thus, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in series, and $R_3$ is in series with $R_4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now what? Well, these two branches both connect at the top and bottom junctions, so the branches form a complete loop. This means that the *group* $R_1$ and $R_2$ is in parallel with the *group* $R_3$ and $R_4$. This spells out the following roadmap for the circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in series\n",
    "1. $R_3$ and $R_4$ are in series\n",
    "1. $R_{12}$ and $R_{34}$ are in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last line, I have written the groupings in terms of their equivalence resistance, as a hint that we cannot do anything there until we first complete the series groupings $R_1$ and $R_2$, and $R_3$ and $R_4$. In other words, we have to start with the first two simplifications before we go further. Writing out a roadmap like this can help decide which simplifications to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we go through the process of circuit simplification, which I spell out here. Notice that the steps listed below are basically the ones we did in the previous examples, but there are some extra things thrown in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw the circuit diagram for the original circuit. You can rearrange the drawing, if necessary, to help you understand the circuit.\n",
    "1. Make a roadmap of which resistors are in series or parallel with each other (including equivalent resistances as appropriate).\n",
    "1. For every simplification, redraw the circuit with the new equivalent resistor, and set up the VIRP table matching the simplification. Find the equivalent resistance of the group in question, and fill it into the table.\n",
    "1. Continue this process until you have a circuit with one battery and one resistor equivalent to all the physical resistors.\n",
    "1. Work back in the reverse direction, filling in the remaining parts of the VIRP tables. *Completely* fill in each table, and check your work, before moving on to the next table! This means verifying that the powers add up to the total, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through this process with the example circuit given in the figure above. I randomly picked five values for the resistances and the battery voltage. Why? The beauty of this process is that you can always write down new problems yourself, and make sure you have the right answer, by using the checks I mentioned before (Do the powers add up? Do the currents add up in parallel, or the voltages in series?). I highly recommend that you do this yourself -- make up a hybrid circuit, and values for the circuit elements, then analyze the circuit -- as a practice method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, back to the example. I have redrawn the circuit below in a different way, to emphasize which resistors are in series or parallel.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we developed the idea of replacing a group of resistors with a single equivalent resistor with the same properties. This simplified the circuit, and repeating this process allows us to eventually get to a circuit we can completely solve using Ohm's law and the power equation. Reversing the simplifications then gives the properties of the physical resistors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of simplification can be applied in many other contexts. If you take an electrical engineering course, you will see that a large number of such methods have been developed for other situations, such as the $Y-\\Delta$ transform, and the more general star-mesh transform, for resistors. There are other such techniques when other types of circuit element are involved. All of them depend on the basic concept of replacing one group with another, simpler group with the same electrical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit simplification method used in this lesson only works if we can merge all resistors together using series or parallel groupings. Often this is not possible, and another path is necessary. This will be explored in the next lesson, when we return to Kirchhoff's laws. This will give a method of writing down equations relating the properties of the resistors, which can be solved for their values. Although it can be more mathematically involved, this technique is far more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe a resistor circuit in terms of series and parallel resistor groups.\n",
    "* Construct the appropriate VIRP table(s)  to solve a resistor circuit."
