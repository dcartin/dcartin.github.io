    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have only talked about collisions along a line (1D collisions). There, we saw how to use the coefficient of restitution in the center of mass (CM) frame, along with the equations of relative motion, to find the results of a collision in the lab frame. These 1D collisions obey conservation of momentum, so this gives us another perspective on the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question now is, how to extend this beyond colliding objects moving on the same line. These will be \"glancing\" collisions, where the two objects do not hit along the line connecting them, but instead \"off to the side\". This will result in a force on each object accelerating them (for an instant!) in a different direction. For example, in the picture below, two spheres moving along the same line collide, but they do so such that the point of collision is not along the line they move. Thus, the two forces also point off at an angle. Remember that the forces give the directions of the *acceleration*, not the *final velocities* of the spheres!\n",

    "\n",
    "Our plan for this lesson is the following. First, we will use the scalar product to help us extend what we did with 1D collisions to find the final velocities of two objects. Building off of this, we will program the physics of 2D collisions into a vPython simulation, where we have moving disks inside of a square box. Then, we can show that momentum is still conserved in these collisions. Finally, we will see how to use conservation of momentum to solve generic problems of 2D collisions.\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain how to use the scalar product to find the final velocity of an object after a 2D collision.\n",
    "* Use a procedure or function in Python to carry out part of a program.\n",

So, if the parallel momentum component was zero before the collision, it will be zero after. For the perpendicular parts, the collision just switches the signs of each of these -- the objects move away from each other, rather than towards each other. Since both components switch signs, then if the perpendicular momentum component was zero before the collision, flipping the signs of both perpendicular velocity components will not change that.\n",

    "That is what occurs in the CM frame, but what about the lab frame? Do we, as observers watching this process, see conservation of momentum as well? The answer is yes!

We will see this collision model again in Lesson 17 (fluids), when we use it to simulate the pressure of a fluid on the walls of its container. Thinking in terms of molecules as elastic spheres was crucial in developing a physical theory for gases.\n",

    "Before this lesson, we had talked about collisions and momentum conservation for 1D collisions. That featured the case where the point of collision was on the same line as the motion of the objects. Now, we have seen what happens when this is not true, for glancing collisions of two objects. This naturally leads to 2D motion after the collision. We have seen how this process works in two ways. The first was to focus on the collision itself, with a coordinate system of unit vectors ${\\hat e}_\\perp$ and ${\\hat e}_{||}$, based on the line between the two objects when they collide. We used this to find the final velocities of the objects, and constructed a vPython simulation. We will see the latter again as a model of a fluid in Lesson 17. Using this as another proof that conservation of momentum holds for these collisions, we then considered two example problems of solving analytically for the final velocities.\n",
